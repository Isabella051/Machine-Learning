Hungry and a little inebriated after a Saints' win on a Sunday and mulling over what to eat, my s.o. and I decided on Kebab.  The menu comes simple; usually a pork option, a chicken, and then a falafel which can be made vegan or just vegetarian. I'm a huge falafel fan so I ordered the falafel and the s.o. ordered the gyro. The kebabs come on a flat baked bread, which I actually prefer to a pita since they can hold up to all the dressings. My falafel came with a nice heaping portion of arugula, beets, hummus, and tzatziki. The falafel didn't taste fried and had lots of flavor, so I like to think that my meal here was healthy. I think I'll probably be ordering a meat option next time because I couldn't help myself from stealing bites of the gyro kebab which was covered in a cilantro sauce. We also ordered a side order of fries, which were okay. They're thick cut fries that don't have that much crunch to them, but they do come with an addicting garlic aioli. Both the meat option and the falafel tasted extremely fresh, yet filling.

The cheese was thoroughly incorporated into the grits, not just shredded cheese thrown on top. I really appreciated that. The grits were creamy and only needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper. The bacon had a really good flavor and was crispy and chewy. The toast, however, took me by surprise. I normally write toast off, but this toast was really good. It was chewy with a nice bite and had a good flavor. It paired well with the butter and grape and strawberry jelly.

Great bikes: all the bikes seemed brand new (plus made in America) and were very well taken care of and super comfortable. They are pretty large cruisers that would be bad if there were any hills in the city but are perfect for the super flat city of New Orleans. They also have super cushiony seats and some have baskets perfect for carrying purses and other things.   Tip: the men's bicycle seats are way more comfortable that the women's. They don't have baskets on them but, if you are a girl, it may be worth going with a guys bike for the better seats. Some of the roads are pretty bumpy.  3.

My eating schedule was already jammed packed but I somehow made a little room for this spot. How could I not? It's like being in Seattle Washington and not trying out the original Starbucks despite being mere steps away.  Unlike the original Starbucks that started it all though which kept it's original historic decor and logo, this place have disappointingly modernized the interior and would not look out of place at any other location in the US. There is no sense of history in it.  Despite that, I read through multiple reviews that Popeye's taste different and even better than what is to be found elsewhere in the US because of the difference in spice that they use.  This I found to be true although for me it wasn't as big a difference as I had assumed.  Seems more tender and moist than my last few experience with the chain too.

The difference is that you are supporting a local business and the clothing and styles are a little bit different than the big name designers.  The store is big and roomy. They have converted a blackjack table into a counter top for the cash register, the paper that they fold your clothes in looks like money, and their tags and business cards look like playing cards!",Shopping

Yes, it looks sketchy, and many times looks like it may have closed. Although they claim that they don't allow pick up after 9pm, I have found that if you tap on the window and give them sad puppy dog eyes they will let you inside (protip: make sure your guns/knives/bowstaffs/etc aren't visible when you do this....that might ruin the puppy effect).  The pizza is pretty good - not the best in the city (slice or PD), but much better than your domino's or the nearby dough bowl (an less saturated with drunk 18 year olds).

I love it so hard. This one star rating is NOT for the type of food, the way it's prepared, or the how healthy it is. Because it's delicious. Burger King is a godsend, handed down to man from the heavens above and I will continue to eat it long after the FDA inevitably discovers that it's the cause of all human pain and suffering.  Having said that, I'm giving this Burger King a one star rating for how terrible the service is at this particular location. I know what you're thinking and no, I'm not crazy. I don't expect a lot from fast food restaurants. I'm not asking for a maitre d' to escort me to a private white table clothed booth for one while I dine on Chicken Fries accompanied only by the sounds of my own heavy breathing. I'm not even asking for the employees to smile when they pretend to give a fuck about my extra BBQ sauce packets. All I ask is that when I order drive-thru you DON'T ASK ME TO PULL AROUND AND WAIT BY THE DOUBLE DOORS.  Let me get this straight. You have two drive-thru windows. The first one is never used. Every time I've ever ordered food you tell me to pull up to the second window. After I've ordered and payed you tell me to pull up and wait in the parking lot and someone will walk my food to me.

It all started with one cute top--a friend dragged me in there, promising adorable clothing that would hug my curves (I'm an hourglass size 6-8 and rarely do I find flattering clothing in department stores). I ended up getting my wedding dress, shoes, corset and accessories from them. Though their day dresses are pricier than mass-market fare, if you take proper care of them (dryclean only or at most handwash cold) they will last and flatter you for years and years. For my wedding attire, I still ended up paying hundreds less than ladies who opt to go to one of those wedding-in-a-box stores. Plus I can wear those heels and gorgeous, floor-length red dress over and over.  As for those who have had unfriendly experiences, keep in mind that Candice, the owner and designer, has extensive experience with the European market and models the store after the European (especially Parisian) style of shopping. The salesladies aren't there to be chummy and will not give you much attention unless it appears that you are serious about a purchase or about putting an outfit together. Then they will give you their undivided attention and suggest ways of pairing garments and accessories. They will not lie and tell you something fits when it doesn't. They will, however, make sure they do whatever is needed to make the piece look right for you, including finding the right size, helping you lace a corset or shoes, or running to the back to get stays or pins.  They did just that when I went in for my wedding outfit. I also appreciate that they gave me ample time to examine every piece. Their no-exchange policy is strict, but if you're seriously going to pay $450 for a dress, you are allowed to take your time and examine it in thorough detail. You might drop some serious cash in a visit, but you will feel and look amazing--and you will wear these numbers time and time again (and yes, men and women alike *will* complement you).

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern.   The layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need.   Though they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well.   Our group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niÃ§oise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken.   All the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets.   We settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet). With the added drinks and tip it came out to under $35 a person, which is an excellent price for such a delicious white-linen lunch.

Then the security guard walked to f and ms and we thought he was trying to tell the people at f and ms not to let us in. F and ms let us in bc they have great workers who actually know how to check an ID. Moral of the story is that for some unknown reason Gritz decided not to let my legal friend into their bar, but most importantly the doorman and security guard were being assholes. The security guard has a huge ego and believes he has the same authority as an actual cop. I love f and ms and I appreciate its ability to respectfully accept all people into its bar that are over  21. But Gritz is a whole different story. I witnessed Gritz disrespect one of my best friends in a way that no one should be disrespected. I am still confused as to why this bar denied entry to my legal friend.

Antique shops always draw me right in and the ones on Royal Street were no exception.  I've always been a sucker for a time-honored piece piece of jewelry.  I was lucky enough to get my husband's great-grandmother's engagement ring as my own.  This ring is originally from the Edwardian era which has led me to search out other pieces from that time or made in that style.  It was an interesting time in history following as it did the Victorian era which many of us tend to know more about.  At Joan Good Antiques, you'll find quite an array of jewelry, not all of it antique and not all of it precious.  It's just a fun treasure hunt  to look around to see what you might find on any particular visit.   Sifting through things is always half the excitement for me in going to antique shops whether it's for jewelry or anything else.  I did find some pieces with gorgeous metal work, beautiful gem stones and some captivating amber pieces.  I've become interested in cameos the last few years and there were a couple of nice examples here.  Alas, I didn't buy anything on this trip and there was nothing Edwardian this time; I was sorely tempted by a couple of things however.  I'll be back for another look-see on my next trip. A walk down Royal Street while in New Orleans is a must in my opinion and this is one of many antique places worth your while.   The antiques you find in various cities across the country provide another way of learning something about history so I think they're worth seeking out.",Shopping

We had the special- avocado crab salad to start. Mustard, crab and avocado just really don't pair very well and the crab didn't taste fresh at all. Then we had the oysters Rockefeller which, honestly, I found inedible. Though I will say, the large size of the dish is really unbelievable for the price you pay ($10). The oysters were gigantic (I'm sure some people will love this, but I found them to be pretty gross) with some green purÃ©e on top of them which had both an unpleasant taste and texture.

Maybe that's the reasons behind the experience...maybe not.   1. The menu is too extensive, I feel like they need to condense it and narrow down the options. There's wings, burgers, pizza, riblets, AHI TUNA even...too much. It took me forever to decide on what to actually eat.   2. There are NO drink menus so you don't know what the beer or alcohol costs. Which would've been extremely helpful for me. I drink Jack Daniels but honestly $7 for a 6 ounce cup is NOT appealing. However, i didn't know i was paying $7 for a 6 ounce cup until I got my check. And I didn't know I was paying $6 for a Sweetwater Blue (which is also a cit overpriced, I'm used to about $3.50/$4.50).   3. The wing sauces are NOT premade before the shift. There were some sauces we wanted to test first before ordering the wings and apparently the cook in the kitchen has to make the sauce when there's an order for wings. So asking for a taste took about 10 minutes. THEN, apparently you have to PAY FOR A TASTE! Because the taste is the WINGS!!!! Like my husband & I had 5 wings land in front of us. 3 wings for the sauce i was tasting and 2 for him. ODD RIGHT?!?!? Yeah, I knew I wasn't the only one to think so. So it kinda ruined my appetite because I ordered a 5-piece wings and was full after 2 because of the taste test. It seems like that's actually giving food away ya know.   4. My total was $53.60 after taxes. Yes, for 2 people at a sports bar I paid $53.60 and we essentially got 2-5 piece wings ($5.75/each), side of fries ($3.50), 4- 6 ounce drinks ($28) and a beer ($6). So after tip I paid almost $70 AT A SPORTS BAR!!!!!!!!!!!   Like I said, service from the bartender was great!! She was friendly and highly attentive.

Honestly, it looks a little sketchy from the outside... Don't let that scare you away. Inside it's warm and inviting. It's an order-at-the-counter type place, so you order at the counter (with the help of the giant menu boards), and they bring everything (even drinks) to the table. They brought out our salads first, then our pasta, which I liked. Service was quick and friendly!  Now for the food... It was pretty good! They were doing 50% off Small Plates, so my boyfriend and I both started out with the Caesar Salad, which was honestly not great. (There's no Parmesan or pepper on it!) The crouton was really tasty though, and I added Parmesan at the table. Not bad for being $3, though I might have been annoyed if I had paid $6. As for pasta, both of us did Make-Your-Own. (It's what made me want to come here in the first place.) I ordered the Rigatoni w/ Grandma's Bolognese (+ Italian Sausage). My boyfriend, who is Celiac and therefore gluten-free, got the Gluten-Free Fusili w/ Puttanesca (+ Gulf Shrimp). Overall, we loved and were really impressed by the housemade pasta. Both of us thought the sauces were really flavorful too, though if I returned I'd probably choose something less traditional. Boyfriend really, really liked the gluten-free pasta. It is, amazingly, housemade as well! (We found this out because Boyfriend liked it so much he asked what brand it was and they said they make it in the back. Nice!)  Overall, this is a great casual place with tasty food. I also really like the flexibility of the Make-Your-Own Pasta option. Seems like it provides a little something for everyone.

It may be newish to New Orleans, bartenders taking ten minutes to make a drink to which they add tiny drops of special flavorings, but this has been going on in other cities for quite some time. The general consensus has become that it should never take more than a couple minutes to make a Cuba Libre - even if you have a handlebar mustache and are wearing suspenders while doing it. The two stars here is for the pellet ice that does make up the majority of the cocktail. Good stuff. Didn't try the food and was not impressed by what I saw on the menu.

I selected Provolone cheese for his sandwich and that was a HUGE mistake, he said his sandwich had NO flavor no matter how hard he tried he just couldn't finish.

After waiting for about 10 minutes for a drink, we have up and sat at a table, where we ordered. There was only one server, although a second bartender did arrive. I ordered a beer from the menu and both the server and the manager came to ask me twice what beer I wanted before they finally put in the order. The wait for most of the night was very long for a drink, and the place was never full. However, they started turning people away because they said the fire marshal was restricting how many people could be there. In fact, two in our party were trying to go downstairs to smoke, as they could not smoke on the balcony, and were told that if they left they wouldn't be able to come back, even though they had an open bar tab. It was thoroughly disappointing for such a nice location to be that woefully unprepared. At one point there were two managers keeping people out, but no one helping the lone server.",Nightlife

Located on the ground floor of the historic Pontchartrain Hotel, I would have never known about this bar if it weren't for Yelp (Thanks Marielle S.).   The bar has a very cool atmosphere. The wall and bar area is adorned with paintings of Louisiana bayou scenes done by a famous local artist. Apparently the large painting on the wall is insured for a million dollars. This seems a bit odd since people can sit next to it and rest their head on the wall, but it is a very cool painting.  The bar feels very fancy, because of the history surrounding it, but doesn't feel pretentious. I think I would be comfortable here dressed up, or in casual clothes. Not many bars can accomplish the fancy, yet laid back vibe.  Service was very good. The bartender was friendly and showed great skill at making ultra fancy drinks. The selection of beer was admirable, including Nola Irish Channel Stout on draft.  I really liked this bar and hope to come back soon.

Also, the tofu doesn't come tasty and fried as it does in places like Lily's, Mint and Magasin (though the really awesome counter guy who may be the owner said that I could definitely order it fried if I wanted, which is awesome). The fresh spring rolls come with a tasty peanut sauce... there was something missing in them, perhaps tofu? I've definitely had better and not sure if I'd order these again.

The red bean chili is such a good idea!  I thought it would be just like red beans and rice, but it was made like an actual chili and I loved it.

My burger was EXCELLENT and the tomato was absolutely awesome!  While the French toast was flavorful, it was a little soggy for my tastes, but my daughter liked it.   While talking with the owners we found out they were from Detroit and so is her grandfather and they had REAL hot dogs from Detroit, so I had to take two to go.  I asked for them raw simply because I knew he would want to cook them himself and he went on and on about them and how good they are.  I am a native NYer and when I asked them if they had any white coney's they said sadly no, they did not, as they were from Detroit and white coney's are only from NY.

Okay, service: we had GREAT service and I really liked our waitress by the time we were finished but ... when she first approached our table, I wondered if she was a bold pan handler coming inside the restaurant to ask for money. She came directly up to our table from the sidewalk (maybe she'd been on a break outside?), and didn't smile or introduce herself. She pointed to the menu and asked what we wanted. We went with it and told her. Once she had our order, she was really attentive and good to us, replacing drinks quickly, checking in about the food.

Second, they don't serve French toast which is personally my favorite and how can you do breakfast with no French Toast.  Fair Warning: It's a cash only establishment but they do have an ATM in the diner.  The Pros: A healthy amount I must say. My usual are grill chicken with Grits, and a waffle which all does a stomach good. They are good with altering specials, also the place just seems real.

12503,29.927221,-90.074369,Finger Lick'n Wings,17,"As a transplant from outside of Buffalo, trying to find an acceptable chicken wing in New Orleans has been a depressingly daunting task.  In my search of the Southeast Louisiana for a good wing, it took a number of years before I found Finger Lick'n Wings.  While they are not quite as good as those in the Wing Motherland, they are the best around.  I have been going to this wing joint for years, and tried just about all the sauces.  My personal favorites include the Obama, St. Torcha, Mardi Gras, and Who Dat.  Just to note - they carry a huge selection of sauces, and are sure to have something that suits your fancy.  As far as the wings themselves, they are larger than the typical wing served around here, and are actually cooked correctly - which is apparently surprisingly difficult here in New Orleans.    Of of the time of this review, it appears that they are renovating the inside and painting the outside - I'll update if necessary.  They are mostly a takeout-based joint right now, but are trying to move to a dine-iin restaurant.  They are also pursuing a liquor license for the location.  I believe they has Barbecue on the menu for a while (around Mardi Gras), but I'm not sure the chef brought in to do it is still around.  Every time I visit something changes, usually for better.  On the downside (which is from a wing purist standpoint) they do not serve Bleu Cheese and Celery with the wings - the big strike keeping them from hitting five stars.  I cannot speak for the other food on the menu, since I stick with the wings.  If you're in the neighborhood, stop by and grab some wings Buck or Troy - you won't be disappointed!",Restaurants

I gave them 4 stars because they didn't have a waitstaff-you had to order your drinks from the bar, and I didn't get a welcoming friendly vibe like I did at other places. For sure check this out for a change from the dingy bars and enjoy this upper scale one.",Nightlife

The verdict? Excellent food, excellent service, excellent value. The only thing not excellent? My photos which don't do the dishes full justice. Can I give it 4 1/2 stars?!  I got there around 8pm. It was almost full. I was seated at a four-top, which was fine, tho I did offer to sit at the counter by the kitchen as I didn't want to take up extra space. My server Randy was very knowledgeable and guided me to choices that left me happily sated.  Started with the Verlasso Salmon (fermented Napa cabbage, cashews, cilantro, sweet peppers, sesame seeds, black garlic vinaigrette) SO delicious!! (Note: The presentation was MUCH nicer than my photo; I had already had a bite or two before taking the pic. It arrived in a kinda pyramid formation.) It's the type of dish you want to have another of as soon as you finish eating it. Sometimes in a dish like this you get lotsa the extras and only a little of the featured item. Not here; there was LOTS of salmon!  Decided to splurge and also get the Roasted Bone Marrow with pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes and watermelon radish slices, as you don't often see this on menus. Not only was it very very good but (a) unlike some places where you just get the marrow and some bread or, in this case, baguette slices, here the pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes, watermelon radish slices and, a goodly amount of, I believe, dill, fleshed it out wonderfully & imaginatively and (b) for a change, there was a pleasingly plentiful amount of baguette slices so I didn't have to ask for more. Bone marrow may not be to everyone's taste...which just means more for me!!  Crispy Pork Chop (grilled corn, mint, cucumber, avocado, buttermilk, watermelon molasses) Crispy it was; I actually thought it was too crispy, but hadn't realized that was what it was billed as--though I wouldn't've minded it being a little more tender/moister, I guess you can't complain about something for being what it's supposed to be. That said, the watermelon molasses (the brown swirl around the pork chop) was so yummy it should be sold in sex shops for people to spread all over their partner's body after which it can be licked off. Lol Seriously, I asked my server for more of it and covered that part of the chop that wasn't already covered with the buttermilk. I don't think I licked its ramekin...but I sure wanted to!   Salted Caramel Budino (orange and pistachio)  I wasn't familiar with the budino concept and, while I enjoy caramel, the pleasures of the Salted"" part always escape me; once I got to the pudding beneath the caramel topping",Restaurants

Alas, not open at 1:30 in the afternoon. That gave me time to Yelp it and learn that the day you really want to eat here is Thursday when they make the seafood baked potatoes.  Everybody else wanted Italian on Thursday, so I decided to get a couple of those potatoes to go for later. 6:00 I go in there and the joint is hoppin'!

A potato with seafood and crab meat is $12 with tax, and one would make a light meal or big side for two people. The potatoes are cooked just right, covered with shrimp and crabmeat in an Ã©touffÃ©e-like sauce with a delayed afterburn that's not overwhelming. I loved it!

I had to put in a second claim with Asurion to get a second replacement phone, which came in the mail two days ago.    After I received my second replacement I was unable to get service on my phone (i.e. making and receiving calls).  I brought the phone to Verizon.  They said the reason I could not make/receive calls was because my phone line was suspended due to a a report that the phone has been lost or stolen"".

Let me start by saying the girl who waited on me couldn't have been either nicer or more polite.  I arrived at 10:30 and ordered 5 spicy chicken tenders.  I totally expected there to be a wait since they had just opened.  I pulled around, paid and then was asked to back up by the cashier at the window.  I have been asked to pull forward many times at other places when the food was going to take a while but this was a first for me. She wanted me to back up at least 15 feet.  As I sat in the car waiting to be summoned back to the window, I decided that I could not let this girl off the hook and planned to ask why this bizarre request was asked of me.  All I could think of was someone pulling up behind me and thinking that I was a complete idiot for stopping short of the window when there were no cars in front of me.  Believe me, I love using my horn and I would have honked at me.  After about 5 minutes, she reached out of the window and waved at me to pull forward.  When I asked her why I had to pull up, she told me that they would get a bad rating if I had to wait too long at the window for my food.  Really????????  I was so amused at her total lack of understanding of what she had just divulged to me, but I refused to call to complain for fear she may lose her job (FYI, for you Popeye's people, this was a few months ago).  Personally I think it is idiotic to place such pressure on people not even earning a living wage.  As everyone knows, fast food is not always fast.  I would much rather wait for hot, fresh food than be served something sitting under an orange light for one hour because these people cooked way too much chicken out of fear that the drive-thru timer police were coming to get them.

We learned how to make crawfish etouffee and it was creamy and it's was so flavorful and tasty. I personally am not a fan of seafood and was shocked at how much I loved the dish.

I usually prefer corn tortillas, but the shrimp and fish came on flour, and these were some good flour tortillas. Nice and spongy. The al pastor was a bit dry, and could have used some sauce. I don't think it's prepared on a spit in the traditional fashion. Had guac and ceviche, too, both of which were fantastic. Tacos are 4 dollars a pop.  We had mezcal margaritas, which were tasty as well. Mezcal is good, it tastes like an old boot, but in a good way. Made the margaritas stand out from the rest. Cocktails range from 8-13 dollars.

Chef Sue is knocking it out of the park - she is back with a vengeance! Run, don't walk, to this phenomenal new gem in mid-city.   We attended as a party of 8 and therefore tried most of the appetizers. I do not consider myself to be someone who normally likes octopus, but the baby octopus appetizer will make a convert out of the most reluctant. If you like octopus, this may become your absolute favorite octopus dish in the city...or anywhere. The murder point oysters with Meyer lemon granita are light, delicious, and salty fresh from the sea.  The goat cheese agnolotti is served with homemade potato chips on top; the contrast in texture and saltiness of the chip/sweetness of the cheese, is sublime. The grilled lobster curry is as good as it sounds, and the portion is very generous. The wagyu carpaccio - is healthy and super delicious.  The final appetizer we tried was an Asian fried veal rib with scallion egg fried rice - fantastic and not to be missed.  As for entrees, there are three fish dishes: halibut, snapper and flounder. You really can't go wrong with any of these dishes. All three are outstanding. There are also pierogis, which are so good a carnivore won't miss the meat, and a really beautiful and contemporary version of beef bourguignon.  Someone at our table had chicken and loved it - I would not ever order chicken while eating out so I did not waste any room in my stomach on that dish.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate pot du creme, which had cocoa nibs, sea salt and whipped cream - this is rich and wonderful if you are a chocolate lover. The apple-cranberry crisp with bourbon ice cream was my husband's favorite, and it is a winner. .

I ordered the No. 21 cocktail, and it was perfect.    After cocktails, we were led upstairs to the second floor of the restaurant where Mario waited on us.  He is amazing and knows the menu very well.  We both got the soup of the day to start, which was a baked potato and corn chowder.  The smoky flavor from the bacon in the soup was phenomenal.    The bread was also great!  There was an option of Ciabatta or a JalapeÃ±o corn muffin, and I opted to try both.  The Ciabatta bread was perfect for dipping into the soup, and the jalapeno corn muffin had the perfect flavor of jalapeno without being over-the-top spicy.   For my entree, I ordered the pumpkin gnocchi with duck prosciutto off of the appetizer menu.  The gnocchi was made fresh and to perfection, and the duck prosciutto was delicious and unique.  I also ordered a side of the caramelized brussels sprouts, which were also delicious.  I am greatly disappointed when I order brussels sprouts, and they are not cooked enough; however, Emeril's cooked them to perfection.

It's amazing and a great compliment to fresh veggies and warm tortilla. The black beans are smoky and delicious and I recommend you sub shredded cabbage for lettuce for a nice change in flavor profiles. The chipotle sauce is a favorite as well. Just watch for the nickel-and-diming that can happen when you add things like sour cream and guac. It can add up quickly. Also, have the queso. It's warm and beer-y and delicious. If you're not in the mood for beer or a margarita, pair your meal with the Jamaica tea, sweetened hibiscus goodness.

No self respecting dive bar would be sporting white fixtures.  The decor is interesting.  What is with all the John Daly stuff?  Multiple TVs are available, about half tuned to the Bills game.

Make sure to ask if they have ube in as it makes a huge difference. Make it a priority to check them out especially if you're a vegetarian.  You won't be disappointed.,Restaurants

The head waiter came out and explained with great detail the specials for the night, but I went for menu regulars, the maytag blue cheese salad and the pecan crusted drum. I wanted more salad, it was so good, I ate it up so fast. The drum was excellent too. It had this soy butter sauce on it that was so good and topped with crawfish. I was definitely happy with my meal and glad I had the experience.

The steak was dry and not tender at all and they gave a lot of it. The mushroom taco was deconstructed and you have to put it together yourself. The drum was also dry and flavorless. A little hot sauce could have made each of these dishes a little better.   Octopus botanos - came with potatoes and poblano rice. Large pieces of octopus, rice was tasty.   Cauliflower app w/ salsa seca - roasted cauliflower, had good crunch to it. Salsa was creamy and just okay, not enough flavor. Not something I would order again.

I was just so impressed by the owner of NOBS and his customer service I just had to give a shout out.   About two weeks ago I came home from a road trip to discover my girlfriend had flattened one of my tires and somehow rattled my rear rack loose. It was a mess. I brought it in and he fixed me up with a new rear tire and rebuilt my rack for a very decent price. I also really appreciated him cleaning up the frame itself, because when I brought it in it looked like it had been dragged through the mud. I was kind of embarrassed but he didn't seem to mind too much.   Yesterday I stopped by again right before a job interview because it was raining and I suddenly realized the necessity of fenders. I walked in sopping wet with a mud streak up my butt and he told me to come back in just half an hour and he'd have them installed. I grabbed a cuppa and when I returned my bike looked smashing! Parts and service were extremely reasonable, and I appreciated him taking pity on my situation and turning it around so quickly. He also clearly loves his job and always, always, always has a smile on his face.   I'm relatively new to town, but NOBS is now my go-to place for great customer service and reasonable prices.",Shopping

Chef Elon Shaya and the entire Miss River team have created a flavorful New Orleans menu and thoughtful craft cocktails.   We started with the New Orleans Rum punch, which was equally balanced in flavor, sweetness, and strength. As a result, we each enjoyed two of these cocktails!  Our meal included: Crab au gratin, Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken with sauces, red beans and rice, and baked sweet potato.   The crab au gratin was my least favorite item. It was good, but quite an expensive appetizer. While the crab meat itself was sweet, succulent, and fresh, the serving size (approximately 6 ounces) for $18 was a bit rich. Also, the au gratin topping was appropriately toasted but the entire dish lacked flavor/seasoning and a binding component (i.e., creaminess).  The Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is a show-stopper! The crust is crunchy and flavorful, the meat is tender, and the overall presentation is magnificent! The staff initially serves the chicken whole, for purposes of presentation. Immediately thereafter, it is whisked away to the carving station. By the time the pieces of chicken return, resting deliciously on a bed of rosemary, the accompanying sauces are there at the table waiting. There are three sauces, which are seasoned honey, crunchy red pepper, and a green herbs. Each of the sauces provided their own flavor, from sweet to spicy to pungent. Truly, the chicken was so perfectly seasoned that the sauces were not required, but they did add to the overall chicken experience.  The whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is an a la carte item, so we chose red beans and rice and baked sweet potato as accompaniments. The baked sweet potato was classic and delicious. The red beans and rice dish was well-seasoned and spicy. The red beans may be too spicy for non-Orleanians but a nice complement to the chicken. Plus, the rice was cooked perfectly!  The sweet end to the meal was lagniappe from the staff! While my specific recollection may be slightly amiss, the two different treats were chocolate chicory cookies and banana pralines.

Let me start by saying the food was OK - not the best, but certainly decent.   My reason for a 2 start review was due to service. To start, when I went to order wine by the glass, they were out of my first two selections (they maybe sell 4 wines by the glass). The waitress told me that I should opt for an alternative, that was approximately $6 more by the glass. I should have asked, but I assumed she would have charged me the lower price considering they were out of the wine I requested. It was kind of tacky - not the diners fault your lower price point items are out of stock, if anything she should have been upfront about this when we told her we'd be drinking wine by the glass that evening.   secondly, I was on the phone describing to my sister where the restaurant was so she could meet us, and the waitress overheard me (mis)pronouncing the restaurant name - and she walked over to me, and correctly pronounced the name in my ear (while i was on the phone!). I think she was trying to be helpful, but it was extremely rude and awkward. Who wants their waitress whispering in their ear while they are on the phone? It also came across as condescending. She should have stopped by later and informed me on the correct pronunciation.  overall, the experience just gave me a bad vibe, especially when there is another Italian spot right next door. pass.",Restaurants

The brisket is best when dipped in the Guasacaca (avocado based salsa) which lends a brightness to the rich brisket.   After, we tried the seafood paella which was full of seafood and sausage.    Everything was tasty, though the buffet suffers some due to the lack of traffic as the temperature on some dishes wasn't ideal.  This is anecdotal, but deserves mentioning.

The restaurant itself is as gorgeous as ever, a gem of a fine dining establishment. There was a bit of a crowd, so it wasn't empty which is  a good thing. I can't stand sitting in an empty restaurant. The service was good to above average.   The $19.20 menu provides a few choices for each course. We both ordered the crab and shrimp cake for an appetizer. It was outstanding, one of the better appetizers I have had in a long time. I ordered the short ribs which were good but not great. The sauce was nice and the presentation was nice with a big Portobello on top which was tasty. But the short ribs were cut in pieces and were found under a mound of mashed potatoes. Nothing at all bad about the dish, it just didn't wow. My lovely better half ordered the fish ( drum I think) with tropical fruit salsa and coconut rice, a much better choice. It was very well prepared, especially the execution of the fish which was perfectly moist, cooked just right. For dessert, I ordered chocolate ice cream which consisted of a very tiny, kid's portion (not much more than a tablespoon )of very good ice cream accompanied by about a teaspoon of whipped cream. The better half again ordered better and got the peanut butter mousse which was a much larger portion and excellent, outstanding in fact.  So if you're looking for a nice evening at a grand restaurant but don't want to break the bank, come to Broussard's for good meal and overall dining experience during the $19.20 special.

The Business Bar is a #BlackOwned #WomanOwned establishment and it's amazing to see what they're bringing to Freret Street. The Business Bar is a fusion of a co-op space and restaurant so you can literally be here from morning to night if you needed a semi-permanent space for the day.  I came in the morning so I enjoyed a bowl of their very berry business oatmeal and just about licked the bowl clean. Filling and a healthy option so it was a win in my book. The cold brew wasn't to my personal preference; however, maybe it's an opportunity for them to connect with Mojo down the street!  The first 90 minutes are complementary if you're coming in to co-op and there are plenty of outlets throughout The Business Bar. After that your food & beverage spend is applied to the duration of your stay so if you munch and imbibe throughout your stay it all balances out. You're asked at the very beginning if you plan just to dine-in or co-op and they then break down everything for you.  Make sure to grab a cocktail here as they're not only from Justinis; however, the attention to details is super cute. They use office supplies to hold up the garnishes! I also can't wait to try their frose on a future visit.  You can easily hold a conversation here and the music is fire. I'll definitely be back!",Restaurants

In fact it was easy to see because the protector plate was clean.  Once I was told that they could only give me half of the quoted amount because they are no longer an AT&T store they sent me to the Lakeside store.  Before I left I asked for assurance that they would be able to handle my account.  Of course I get to the Lakeside store and the salesperson smells like onions which is disgusting.

I must say - the exterior does neither Feelings nor Sentiments any justice (Yelpers are right - what names!!?!*!). Very cool - both places. Kind of French country meets shabby chic.  We kept wondering where the heck a balcony would be as we trekked up this dark staircase, but voila! It's all interior magic -- narrow walkway with cute little 2-top tables along the railing - looking down into Feelings courtyard. Music seranades yiu as you hear the relaxing sounds of Feelings' fountain. One of the co-owners greeted us - hooked us up with a pretty good Nappa cab -- which was made instantly fantastic by the introduction of a fabulous cheese plate! We chose the 3-cheese option and let the expert do the choosing. He and his co-owner wife had lived in Nice, and some of that magic came back with them. He asked what we didnt like, what we preferred - and ohlala - the choices and accoutrements were fanbloodytastic...a pungent cows milk cheese wrapped in spruce and washed in local beer; a garlicky cows milk - very softy and creamy; and an aged Gouda (husband and i buy this regularly - yum!!). Candied pecans, sugared walnuts, cornichons, and Castellanos (?? the bright green ones) olives came alongside - and some scrumptious, perfectly-cooked fresh french bread. Heaven!!!! So relaxing. SO charming. Husband-wife duo apparently also teach French lessons along with a wine tasting. What a combo! This place is a total diamond find. Will definitely be back. Merci bien!!  Oh - and how cool - there appears to be a great yoga place right next door. Gotta come back for THAT!",Restaurants

I learned more about agave and how it relates to tequila during a short seminar than I learned during my lifetime.   El Tesoro is a remarkably tasty tequila that takes tequila crafting seriously. It's not only a quality tequila, but it is also a brand that sources agave responsibly. I had no idea that this coveted plant was over harvested to the point where it threatened the environment. The long-nose bat, the tiny mammal responsible for pollinating agave plants has reportedly recovered from near extinction, in part because of the efforts of responsible agave harvesters. The bat requires mature plants to pollinate, so El Tesoro allows 5% of their harvest to mature in order to protect this precious species. Even if it means they reduce their profit in the process. Now, that's something to toast to!  Following the seminar, I was invited to attend the Night in Paradiso event which was a blast! I was able to sample many varieties of El Tesoro, and I even made my own cocktail rim of herbs to take home. The night was enhanced by the smooth sounds of the Vivas band, and a delicious cooking demo by Restaurateur of the Year Edgar Caro!

That is the type of situation i love because i am a true advocate for Yelp! And i am full of bookmarks for places to try. Still a bit indecisive after sifting through what was open and in the right dollar amount, i decided to use my trusted method of picture surfing and long behold, Mia's caught the eye and it is to be trusted, still.   We each ordered an appetizer and shared between the three of us. Everything, i highly recommend. First we had the chargrilled oysters topped with spinach, bacon cheese and parmesan, omfg. Sorry. I'm writing this from memory so i'm a bit shady on the other two entrees, i know one was some type of tomato with thee best tasting melted mozzarella on top and i won't even attempt to try and tell the third, just take my word for it, it was amazing.   I ordered the shrimp pasta, i kept it simple.   One other ordered the fried oyster salad.   And the other got the special of the day which i believe was some type of fish.   Everything was superb.

Overall this is not a bad store, they always greet you when you walk in 'welcome to CVS' but I think this is a company policy not something that is store specific.   Something I like about this place (and CVS in general) is the coupons they give you on your receipts and how you can earn points for purchases over time that can be converted in to 'cash' by reducing your total when you decide to use your points.   One final note is that if you come in the morning right after they open there will be carts and boxes covered in cling wrap full of merchandise everywhere, some stacked almost to the ceiling. I don't know if I'm just lucky and have gone there early several times on whatever day they get their deliveries but it seems like they could be a little more organized. I've seen boxes and random trash everywhere etc. I know they have to do what they have to do and that the merchandise does not just magically replenish itself but to me how they go about making that happen just seems messy and lazy.

The atmosphere is modern and tasteful, dark, cool, and pleasant, though the design seems to be trying a little too hard for cool.  That's not really a bad thing; it's endearing rather than offensive (If it matters, they seem to have gotten the music thing under control.  Again, it's more funny than off-putting).  If you can't be bothered to read the whole review, I'll give you the takeaway message right now: order a big Sapporo draft (or Kirin Ichiban if that's your thing) and a couple or three of the small plates.  You will enjoy it.  Bring friends so you can trade bits of the appetizers.  If you're still hungry, order some of the killer noodles.  Maybe the sushi's good, maybe it isn't.  I haven't bothered to find out because the rest of it is great.  Detail-wise: the gyoza are rich, redolent little pockets of juicy flavor that come with a great citrus sauce for dipping.  It's not the overpowering raw soy flavor most places give you.  The takoyaki are intriguing, with an internal texture that's somewhere between a pancake and a set custard, spiked with bits of meaty, chewy octopus and topped with the deep ocean funk of katsuoboshi.  The seaweed salad is redolent of sesame oil and has a satisfying crunch.  Also, try some of the fried skewers.  I got the pork, which was crunchy on the outside and came with tonkatsu sauce, which is sort of what you'd get if barbecue sauce and ketchup gave birth to a talented and delicious child.  I can't imagine that they're any less talented at skewering and frying (or grilling) other things.  And if you're still hungry, there are noodles in abundance, and good noodles.  The ramen, if you're used to packets, will be revelatory (though it's not the best I've ever had, I eat it happily).  It's rich and filling, coming in head-sized bowls.  Even better is the yakisoba, a hot fried noodle dish that came out steaming and savory, with the meaty, slightly charred flavor that would, in Chinese cuisine, be called wok hee.  It's like what you wish lo mein could be.  The food's great, the beer is cold and appropriate to the food.  There are even karaoke rooms you can rent.  What's not to like?",Restaurants

The corner store designation is a bit generous, as their stock of dry goods is seriously lacking (mainly just cold drinks and candy...don't come here trying to make groceries).

The prices run anywhere from $6 - $15 depending on what you're ordering and some items are a little steep for a corner store but well worth it ($8 for the pasta...sheesh). If you're ordering something that hasn't been freshly made, they will politely ask you to wait....and I will always wait for hot shrimp, fresh out the grease.  My deduction of one star is mainly because the credit card minimum (aren't those illegal anyway?) and the food is inconsistent.

Now for the food. I didn't go to the pop up when it was there, and I was very excited to eat the food. I am Filipino and I understand that everyone makes each signature Filipino dish differently. The food presentation was very good. But I would still encourage the chefs and the owner to punch up the menu; an issue I have with many asian restaurants in town is that they dilute the flavors that should be in the food. I had the lumpia shanghai [good stuffing but a bit limp in texture], chicken adobo [good portion size but needed to be marinated longer since the flavors of the sauce did not permeate the meat much], and milkfish [fried preparation and again, it needed more marinade flavor]. I can understand that Filipino flavors can be a love it or hate it thing and being a new restaurant, they're still figuring it all out. But if you are gonna have a Filipino restaurant, then make the unique flavors explode as they should. That's what makes Filipino food amazing.

Upon arriving, they escort you upstairs and give you (strong) cucumber water to sip on while you fill out some forms and wait.

The forms asked your standard questions about basic info, allergies, etc but then there were the weird ones that I didn't feel they needed to know for a massage - but I told myself, maybe the forms were standard for all services to keep it simple for them.   I *think* my lady's name was Michelle - don't hold me to that though. We moved to the room where she told me to change and lie on the warm bed and get situated. She began on the front then worked her to my back and then my scalp - which I didn't know was included and was rather intense. The hot towel wrap was a nice addition to her completing her services, however.  Now - there was a question on the form asking if I (or anyone filling out the form for that matter) bruised easily - kind of an odd question but I said no because to my knowledge - no, I don't just bruise randomly.   But then... two days later, I woke up and notice what I didn't initially think was a bruise all over the front of shoulder, was a huge bruise... it stuck around for about 4 days following my massage and just wasn't a cute look. I know Michelle said I was the tensest she had seen in months BUT I didn't think that meant she pushed on my muscles so hard I would bruise! Ouch!

I did and then came back the next night for a second meal. This is unual for me to do while I am in New Orleans as I like to eat my way across the city. The first night I had the Roasted Portuguese Sardines, While this is not a dish for everyone their preparation was excellent and all that was left on my plate were the head and tails. They were seasoned and roasted to perfection. As my entrÃ©e I chose the Trout Campfire with fingerling potato fried egg and lemon butter. A dangerous preparation because if it is not watched carefully it is easy to overcook the fish - mine was perfect.  My only letdowns were with the white wines that were available by the glass.  I tried several white wine offerings and found them weak and tasteless. The white wines were not up to the standards of the food. I also did not have desert as they were sold out of one of my choices and the other choice was not yet prepared. But I came back the next day for meat.  The second night I started with the House Charcuterie Board (YUM!) and a glass of Spanish Tempranillo (a nice wine). I chose the Beef Short Ribs Bourguignon with buttermilk spaetzle and farm vegetable as my entrÃ©e (YUM YUM). Thus was a hearty robust flavorful dish that evoked memories eating the one of those special out of the way restaurants that one sometimes finds in France.  It was French comfort food at its best. I paired this with a glass of the Cote du Rhone.  Both of the red wines were quite good and complemented the food - much better than the whites I had the previous night. The desert - creme brulee- was good and I paired it with a medium dry sherry. A good meal.   The staff were all great and well trained and contributed to a wonderful experience both nights.  I will eat here next time I am in New Orleans because there are many appetizers, and entrees choices that I would love to try. This is a winner!

But what I didn't know is that their prices were so overly inflated to start that even if they gave me a 50% discount I was still over paying.   I went to Helm Paint and told them of my experience with the other guys and to my surprise, I got better service, knowledge, and way better prices without even needing an acct.

I like collecting new varieties of herbs I don't have yet, for example I currently have several types of mint growing just about everywhere (lavender mint, orange mint, variegated mint, chocolate mint).  Mint is wonderful here because it will grow dense in a pot, it will hang over a planter beautiful, and it will just grow legs and stretch itself all over your flower beds.  When you walk by if you just run your hand through it, you will have the scent everywhere.  I also have a beautiful variegated basil that I love and lemon grass that the doggies love to chew on.  The price is great on herbs (under $2 each, and I have gotten a lot of millage out of all of my selections.  This spring I decided to plant a flower bed that was dedicated to butterflies.  I purchased some pintas and some blood flowers.  For a while I thought my garden was unsuccessful.

Cornbread was extra at 75 cents. Everything was delicious except the fried oysters. The batter used for the oysters was different than that used for the catfish.

You can definitely tell they're short staffed based on wait times, and not having full menu offerings, but overall they seem very happy to accommodate or make alternative suggestions.  They do have valet in the hotel for easy parking. You can wait a little while if they're busy, but they were very careful with all the vehicles and all very nice. It's not the easiest place to park, so I appreciate the valet option.   The band was great though not who I would expect to be playing in that venue I guess; I thought more bebop or contemporary Jazz for this space. Duke's band was playing more swing style, but of course, no one was dancing, so it was a bit odd. There wasn't much of a crowd so they took a rather long break in the middle of the set. I don't blame them, but there was a $10 cover charge so after a while it was annoying.   The staff is top notch, even during these odd pandemic times of shortages. A staff member offered to walk us directly into The Blue Dog, and once inside the bar tender checked our vaccine card and tickets, handed us some menus, told us we could have a seat and she'd be around for our orders soon. She made a few drinks for those that came in before us, and it wasn't long before she was around to take our order. We ordered their cheese plate and pretzel dish along with two drinks. What my guest wanted couldn't be made because they were out of one of the mixers, but the bartender offered something else and he was happy with what she made. I went with wine, and had a good pour for the price. The food was over priced for what was served, so I'd skip that if you go. They couldn't find crackers for our cheese plate for a good 15 minutes, but two staff members stopped by to let us know they were working on it and apologized for the delay - and they eventually brought us crackers. Kudos to the staff again.   I appreciated their extra level of service for something as mundane as crackers, and how nice everyone in the hotel was overall. I'll definitely recommend this place based on service to my tourist friends. For a night at a jazz club though it ended up being a bit pricey with parking, drinks, food, and cover charge. If you're already in the area or staying at the hotel, and you've grabbed food elsewhere, $10 cover per person plus one drink each isn't all too bad.   Small complaint - the doorman had the door open - I know it's a New Orleanian thing so people hear the music and want to pay to come inside - but it was the first night the temps dropped, and no one was really prepared for that door to be open. If it's a cold night, bring a jacket and be prepared to keep it on all night. That was my only real complaint, was them keeping the door open and making it cold.",Nightlife

The Pelicans owner stood on the side walk 10 feet from where i was having lunch. He called the city to inquire if the restaurant (tacos and beer) had acquired the proper permits to have a TV on the front patio. He began to spew derogatory comments and racial slurs about the current owners to a buddy of his. Loud enough for all to hear. I was actually shocked and was lost for words.  He then looked at me and made a comment. I believe he thought i was an employee of the restaurant. Once he did, I couldn't help but to say something. It was awful what came out this mans mouth. He continued to shout racial comments from the steps of his restaurant to the Tacos and Beer owner. The cops where called. I was asked by the restaurant if i would stay to speak to the officers.    What makes me sick to my stomach is to know that i was also a patron of this establishment. I can not believe that there are people out there who still believe is fine to use use such derogatory comments in regards to race. He had no care of those around him. The Officers asked me if i was willing to press charges against the Pelicans owner for disturbing the peace.

If you come here on a Saturday or Sunday morning it's fine, but come here when it's basically dead during lunch hour and you'll be waiting. I don't understand why cause there aren't really very many people but the servers seem distracted even though there is virtually no one here. I sat here for at least 10 minutes before they acknowledged my existence and there were only 2 other tables of people, so I believe there was no excuse for this. Also the other tables had to yell for them to come over so they could get takeout containers. My belief is when you have so little customers you should be that much more attentive, seeming that you would like to earn some money for the day. Other than that I would still come here, but I think I might stick to weekends only",Restaurants

In a city that puts out some really amazing food (NOLA, Coquette, Cochon, Atchafalaya, etc), we ran across a few duds who substituted salt for flavor.  i had a pasta with meatballs.  The meatballs were very good - seasoned well with a bit of spice that you'd expect in New Orleans, but the pasta was a gummy, salty mess.  The food came out pretty cold, which didn't help too much.  There are a ton of great places close by - maybe Italian should be avoided in New Orleans in lieu of more traditional food?

Seeing my 60 yr-old companions looking like children at their first parade was the biggest delight for me this year. They did not lose the twinkle in their eye throughout the rest of the trip. When both women caught shoes you would have thought that they had each been given the Hope diamond, telling each other where they were going to display their treasures and holding on to it for dear life.

Now this place has a fairly small surface area off of Bourbon, so it's easy to miss, but if you're like me close your eyes and let the music save your soul. It's only a few blocks off of canal st. for a point of reference. The park is essentially a beer garden oasis and an outdoor venue for local musicians. There is live jazz everyday from 10am until they close, which I believe is midnight and it's free! Within the park there is a bar, so the crew and I grabbed some drinks and sat and vibed to jazz for a couple of hours and people watched. It is definitely a great experience sitting and soaking up some of the rich culture and musical heritage that New Orleans has to offer.  Also there is a wishing well in the middle of the park and all of the proceeds go to a local elementary school to provide band equipment...that stuff ain't cheap and it's for a great cause so try and throw something in.

Don't be shy - dance in front of it. Jump around. You'll love it!  - Team Turtle Training Camp.

In the same area, you can learn how to make emergency phone calls.  (Uh, no, I didn't do that.)  - I found out I can throw a baseball at 30something mph, and reaffirmed that I can't throw a football to save my life.  - The theater is nice and cozy, but I had just missed the show. I did get to take a picture with Stuffie, though. (And I'm still sad I accidentally deleted it.)  - THE PULLEYS.

Nothing world-beating (and if I wanted to, I could get mad at them for their spicy dishes not being particularly hot), but I got a good meal.  For some reason it came in styrofoam containers rather than the typical Chinese food cartons, and I was instructed to hold the bag level to avoid spillage; even being cautious, there was still a bit of sauce on the bottom of the bag.

This has been a long time in the making and I'm so excited for you and your family that this dream has become a reality.  Terrance is a former school art teacher turned full time artist after Hurricane Katrina. Don't be fooled though because he was an artist in new Orleans even before Katrina, but it wasn't until after Katrina when he refined his style and became the well-known artist we know and love today.  I have great admiration for Terrance because although he is now a world renowned artist  he's just as humble as the first day I met him which was a few years before Katrina.  Terrance is so personable to everyone he meets and is humbled by the people he shares this amazing city with.  Thank you for showing the world New Orleans in your own way because it helps others understand the life of the city we call home and all it has to offer through your colorful visions and depictions.

Toast is less than a year old, and word has is definitely out on how good it is.  I knew to arrive early, or I'd have a wait in front of me.  We arrived at 9:30 and immediately found 2 seats at the bar.  The regular tables were all full, one with a party of 12 (tables pushed together).  None of the tables outside were occupied because it was still a little chilly outside.  The atmosphere at Toast is bright and cheerful, albeit small.  You're in pretty close quarters with everyone around you, but I'm fine with that.  My only complaint was that it was VERY LOUD.  They've put foam under the chairs and tables, but it didn't seem to be helping much.  Once the large party left, it got considerably better.  I find the prices at Toast to be extremely reasonable for what you get, with entrees ranging from $10-$14, and smaller side items (like toast topped with prosciutto, honey, and ricotta, or an order of ableskivers) going for $5-$8.    For my entrÃ©e, I had the croque madame.  It was huge and delicious, and was served with a light side salad.  My BF had the hangar steak topped with tarragon aioli, served with roasted potatoes and sunny side up eggs.  His meal was also fantastic.  I was really dying to try some of the ableskivers with lemon curd dip, but their portions are huge and there was just no way.    By the time we left 45 minutes later, there were 15 people outside waiting, and all outside tables were full.  I highly recommend Toast, but you might want to go before 10 if you don't want to wait.",Restaurants

They have other drinks too which are equally well valued.    I also had the Turtle soup, which I've always wanted to try.  It's a New Orleans staple, and served at quite a few places around town. At $6, it was a great time to try.  They even mix sherry in front of you, which is a nice touch.  It was excellent and would order again.

My girlfriend ordered a 8 piece tradition buffalo wings. Now I won't even mention the terrible service or inattentiveness of the staff there, nor will I dedicate this complaint to the fact that her traditional wings were pitifully small (some were only 3/4 the size of a lighter). No this complaint is dedicated to the despicable quality of my jalapeno pineapple wings. It literally was so burnt on the bottom I could lift up the entire contents of the box by pinching any section of the mass. The chicken tasted like it was reheated at least once and it wasn't even warm when I got it. Now even worse, the staff refused to refund the balance of my half of the order onto my card. Can you believe they charged us $27 for these 2 orders of wings and 2 drinks and 2 extra blue cheeses (which I gave back)?

It's the most delicious punch I've ever had: not too sweet, not bitter, and a natural blend of flavors for the perfect punch.  After getting your cash, you would need to park under the bridge and walk across the street. Be careful and pay attention to the light. Keep your car locked and keep an eye out. At this locations there is no place to sit and eat, and it's not really comfortable to order and wait. You're standing the entire time, outside a pickup window; you can imagine how packed it may get if it rains or gets really cold outside.

They have an uncrowded floor of tables and booths and a lunch counter along one side.  The counter faces the cooks' area, which I like because the bustle of multiple grills, fryers, and prep areas serves as a good distraction, not to mention you get frequent interaction with the staff.  They were busy and getting everything done, but they weren't rude or frazzled, and I had a real sweet waitress.  I ordered the fried shrimp po boy dressed, and asked for a side of rebbeans instead of fries.  I almost had second thoughts on that because the burgers that they were cooking right in front of me looked and smelled so good.  I really have a difficult time resisting the grill.  The food was average and is what you would expect in a tourist spot in the Quarter.  They may get another star if I go back for one of them burgers.",Restaurants

I've attended the TBC and the Barre Code class.... so far!  The studio has more of a gym-ey feel to it, but in a way that demonstrates they know their audience and creates a fun, working-out community. They have lockers available and socks for sale. The studio itself is long mirrored room, so you have space on the barre no matter the size of the class. The instructors have microphones and actively adjust the music and lighting. It was all very professional.  Both classes were high energy. The emphasis is on making the most of your time there, and I've both classes were very effective & efficient. TBC incorporates cardio... which is my favorite part of anything. The transitions between cardio and strength were very smooth -- again it all seemed very professional and smooth. Oh, they also made good use of the equipment in class, so if you want to be more challenged, there's a lots of opportunity for that!  I'm all about people getting the right workout in for them. For me, I felt like I needed a little more stretch time between segments and if I were brand new, I may have needed more personal guidance than was available with the microphone. However, I will definitely be incorporating Barre Code into my workout options.

We have been a few times and the food is solid and changes seasonally which is great.  I was disappointed that after choosing this oyster happy hour over several others in the city we were told we had to sit at the bar (we brought our 10 yr old foodie so not an option) in order to have the happy hour prices. The restaurants website did not specify happy hour at the bar neither did Nola eater (other restaurants do specify this as part of their happy hour).  We intended on dining from the menu and not just the happy hour oyster menu which we did so it would have been nice to be extended the oyster happy hour price.  That said we ordered the pig ears which were super crispy and seasoned well, the drum throat which was super flaky and tender but did need a bit more seasoning for my taste, the gumbo which was delicious and the boudin stuffed wild boars heart which was tender and flavorful.  We also ordered from the beer and wine menu and happy with the selections.  Our 10 yr old ordered a great mocktail (tasted like a mojito minus the rum).  Our waiter was very nice and humorous as well as informative as to upcoming beer and wine dinners.  By the way there were only 4 tables at the time (we arrived at 5:45pm) so I would think after my husband asked about the happy hour upon arrival perhaps the manager would have had made a point to notice our check of over $200 and made a point to give us that happy hour special for the oysters.

The furniture, decor, and inviting fireplace all gave the feel of coziness or familiarity in a wealthy vacation bungalow.  The night we went the upstairs was blocked off so just the downstairs was available, and people were lounging on the sofas deep in conversation.  The drinks were strong and well made, the bartender friendly.  She said that the place didn't close and she would be working all night long but it was a quiet night so she was enjoying herself.

The display of barrel aged potables behind the bar is very pretty and very tempting, but from a layout perspective it sucks for the staff.

Even though we all annoyed with the service, We forged ahead and ordered dessert which took about 20 minutes to come out. The dessert was good. We tried 4 different ones, and all split.

It's only two-blocks long but full of life and non-stop entertainment and on any given day of the week, you can hear the live sounds of reggae to Latin to blues.  To kick off a night on Frenchman Street, it's best to do so on a full stomach so stopped into Mojitos Rum Bar and Grill on the edge of Frenchman Street for dinner and a warm up to a night out on the town.  Just like a lot of the other places in the area, Mojitos has their own live entertainment and if u stay late enough on Saturdays a Latin music party. All of this takes place on their beautiful patio but you also do have the option of indoor dining but I highly recommend that you do not do that. Even consider sitting at their large outdoor bar before doing that.  Going to a place called Mojitos means you have to get a Mojito. Due to their namesake, they have plenty of options from specialty drinks to the typical fruit flavor kind. I started off with The Frenchman which was amazing and thank fully strong.  Later on, I decided to get another drink and selected the Ultimate Mojito. I know it said mint syrup and I don't know what I was thinking but it was the ultimate fail. It tasted just like syrup, medicine syrup. If you 'bout that sizzrup, this may be the drink for you.  We order the Jerk Chicken Skewer as a starter and it was so unbelievable delicious! Do you know how hard it is to go to a place that doesn't specialize in Jamaican food and for them to actually get it right? The flavors were on point and the spice level was beyond expectations. To offset the spicy factor, the blackberry brandy sauce added just the right touch.  There are only four choices for main dishes, but they all sounded so good, I still had a hard time deciding. I ended up ordering the Aruba Scallop. It came with grits and I am actually NOT a fan of grits but these were well flavored and a great compliment to the delicate and well cooked and prepared scallops. A dish like this has potential to lack flavor, but it was really good and had a nice kick to it.  My boyfriend ordered the Lechon Asado or as the menu states, citrus marinated roasted Kurobota pork belly. The meal was served with rice and beans. He thought it was really good taste wise, but was disappointed in the portion size which I guess was a little small but I was full after eating my meal.

I was visiting the area with my family and stopped by for lunch.  Tulane's campus was essentially closed with students on break so the restaurant closed early and had a limited menu.

I am  definitely a critic's critic and the type of person which likes to find places that  aren't heavily advertised. I personally believe the food and service of a restaurant  should be  allowed to speak for its self and I must admit a good  happy hour is definitely a bonus.     I was kind of nervous due to the mixed reviews but I had yet to find a thai restaurant which has blown me away and yes I have gone to La Thai,  so i figured I should try and see what this restaurant truly had.  So I went where any curious customer would go and I requested to be sat in the  bar area  and I must say I was not dissappointed.  Their bar area featured the typical stools but also had  an additional  table area  if I preferred. Complete with  a wide selection of import beers and a wine list which showed true care in its creation(I hate seeing kendal jackson on a wine menu or any grocery store brand, lol).   Well back to the experience...I  must give kuddos to the bartender for truly guiding me,  recommendations are one thing but he even had knowledge of specialty items that were not on the menu and unique personal takes on thai staple menu items,(e.g. glass noodles in the pad thai for a lighter filling feeling and add pineapple to it if you truly trust me""  plus he  brought  out an amuse bouche).

While shopping for living room furniture pieces, Bill was more than patient as I walked in at least 10 times over a one month period, each time with tape measure in hand. Since the sofa I wanted was quite expensive, he was quick to offer suitable chairs at lower price points to keep me within budget. I met Patti (the owner) who was also lovely and very attentive to my needs. Another salesperson Cheryl came over to introduce herself as a point of contact since Bill would not be working the day of my delivery. I felt they worked great as a team and were focused on making sure my experience was a positive one.  In the end, the sofa looks better in my apartment than it did in their beautiful showroom.

They signed on the spot and paid the balance in full for a ceremony reception for my wedding.  A couple of months later, we received a very disgruntled email from Jessyka about how she had to leave the company due to many reasons and just wanted to let her clients know that she was available to talk through anything necessary to make the transition better for our events.  After that, there was quite a bit of trouble with the new rep on behalf of the owner. My emails and calls weren't answered or returned and when I went to the restaurant a month before my wedding to try to work out details, I was told I needed to make an appointment. After about 20 minutes, they agreed to just go ahead and meet with me then.  Three weeks before the wedding, I received a phone call stating that even though we had a signed contract that promised 135 chairs, they would only be able to accommodate us if we paid a fee of $400-500.   My fiancÃ© pushed back on the terms of the signed legal contract. She then said we would have the chairs and they would make it work.   The day before my wedding the rep called and said that they were ordering less chairs because the space wasn't big enough to accommodate my guests and that 30 of them will have to stand in the back of the room.  The night of the rehearsal dinner, I was reminded that my dog wasn't written into the contract after being told that she was allowed to walk in the wedding.  It was a stressful and unfortunate lead up to the wedding, but the ceremony itself was beautiful and perfect. The space was great, we ended up getting all of our chairs at no additional charge and they even set up a really nice area in the courtyard for formal photos before the ceremony.  Would I recommend? Probably not. But our wedding couldn't have been more perfect in the end.",Restaurants

Located within walking distance from the universities on Maple Street, Favori is my go-to place for greasy hangover food. It's owned by an older Korean couple who definitely know what they're doing. You place your order at the kitchen and wait for your name to be called. That's my favorite time, where you stand back and choose from the 100+ options of soft drinks and beverages from the coolers lining the long wall. After a short while, your name is called and --whew man!-- the food is exactly what you were looking for. I tried most of everything over the years and the Maple Feast is my usual option. The french fry po boy is also a good choice as well.  Favori is good for a quick bite, better if you're hungover.

All display models are powered via battery or plug and even one that recharges like phone through a usb cord.  Once the remodeling and the shop are complete, I can only imagine how amazing this place will be.  The private appointment was perfect for the first-timer in our group and she felt completely at ease asking questions (the other two of us felt the same way.)  I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a progressive, lady-friendly sex boutique.  They sell safe products - not the cheap toxic ones you find everywhere else in the city.  There is no pressure to buy anything, but we could not help ourselves and all three of us left with bags containing multiple items.  We met with Hope and I can tell you from experience you can ask her just about anything and she will answer without any judgment.  She really believes in educating and empowering women and is an asset to this city.  Their prices are very reasonable for the product you get and well worth it.

We were seated in fact by the General Manager John and his family, and had the pleasure of watching him and his family enjoy multiple waiters and heaping plates of food.  While we waited for service.   After 30 min a waitress approached us and asked us if we had been waited on, we said no, and she said she wasn't sure if we were her table, she left and came back 10 min later and apologized and said she was our waitress.  We ordered drinks and off she went, 10 min later she was back with drinks, Be aware you will pay for water, 2.00 per bottle.  The bloody mary $14.00 was drinkable but nothing special.  We then ordered our entree's I ordered the Crawfish ettouffee and my fiance ordered a bowl of gumbo and the taste of new orleans which was Jambalaya, Etouffee, and redbeans.  Listen I cant stress this enough we grew up on the gulf coast we understand how Gumbo and the other dishes are supposed to taste, if your not from the area you have no idea, so to you it might be good, but let me tell you the food was horrible, the etouffee had no flavor and the gumbo's roux was watery and again had no flavor. The rest of the food was simply not good.  We had purchased a groupon for this place and that included a dessert and so we ordered the bread pudding, again it was horrible, it was tough and rubbery.   That was it, we had had it, so we asked to speak with John the general manager, 20 seconds into our conversation he basically dismissed us and said dont worry ill take care of the meal, while that was generous that wasn't really what we wanted to hear, we continued to try and explain our issues, he then got extremely rude, explained that he was the GM for a multi million dollar operation and if things were that bad, the restaurant wouldn't make it, I disagree, they have a fantastic location on the river in the riverwalk center, and there are plenty of unaware tourist that pay his bills.  He even told me to contact the owner that he would tell me the same thing.  I have yet to do so but im curious as to what his response will be.

I would think the popularity of those 4 items should have been pretty easy to predict but then again I'm sure I would have made other mistakes.  In terms of the burgers, they're pretty good.  I ended up with a venison burger on my first visit cooked medium rare and it was just about right - and the key is that it was still juicy which of course will often be an issue with lean game meats.  The brioche bun was very good and other than the burger being over-seasoned it was medium thickness, seemed to be good quality meat, and tasted pretty good.  Of course, it was $0.25 each to add lettuce and tomato then another $1.00 to add avocado then another $2.00 to upgrade from chips to onion rings then with a drink added the total bill came to almost $16.  For one person.  I mean, it was a pretty good burger and the homemade onion rings were nice but I could have gone to Wendy's for half the price and gotten a burger that satisfied similarly.  Charcoal's actually makes Tru Burger look cheap which isn't easy and it almost makes The Company Burger appear under-salted which also ain't easy.  I still haven't had a great burger in NOLA - give me Michael Symon's burgers any day from B Spot and Bar Symon.  I've also had much better burgers in my previous residences of Portland and Chicago - and they cost less even at sit-down restaurants.  For these prices I want the best and I'd prefer if Charcoal's had a menu of 5-10 great combinations rather than making customers choose all the ingredients for every burger served.

To begin this is not a review on the restaurant end, I've always enjoyed the brunch and have always left satisfied with what I've ordered and the service has always been great. This concerns more with the bar side and the outrageous $20 cover to enter the pool only to leave minutes later because the amount of people was the equivalent to all the people you see in a wave pool at a water park and god knows what's going on beneath the surface.   I have never seen such a lack of urgency with the bartenders both in the front and in the pool area as was displayed today. I understand what it means to be in the weeds but when your staff is dragging or in their case dancing and having casual conversations with other patrons while there are other people waiting to be served and showing no recognition of how long one individual has been waiting there to order vs. someone who just walked up is frustrating as a customer who was just looking to relax. Staffing wasn't the issue, there was more than enough bartenders to handle the crowds both in front and in the back bar. The issue was bartenders who showed zero lack of customer awareness and were rude to customers when voicing their displeasure at the amount if time they've had to wait.   I have always enjoyed the Country Club and have often recommended it to people who want to try something different while visiting out here.

Every arrangement I purchased was exquisite and fresh, so I didn't feel the need to go there and explain what I wanted, I just asked them to arrange something wonderful for my price point.  The arrangement was gorgeous; not what I'd expected, but still lovely and my wife thought they were beautiful.  I can't recall the flowers used, but they were white.  The next day we noticed they'd begun to brown a bit and by evening, they were mostly browned out.  They'd been kept cool and fresh until I placed them on the table for the party.  My wife was disappointed and called Dunn & Sonnier and explained what had happened.  They apologized and asked that we send a photo of the arrangement.  My wife did this and they said absolutely this was unacceptable and said that the next time we wanted an arrangement that they would take care of it!  True customer service!  We weren't at all looking for that, we just wanted to make sure they knew that this happened in the event it happened again to someone else.  So our anniversary came up recently and I called Dunn & Sonnier and explained the situation.  With no trouble whatsoever, they got me another arrangement, more beautiful than the first.  And they lasted over a week, which is all I ask for - give me 5 days of beauty!    Dunn & Sonnier didn't have to do that, but they did because they understand the customer's desires.

I wanted to reserve a table for a party of 10 and decided to call them a week prior (Saturday). I was told to call back the upcoming Wednesday for a reservation. Let's back it up a bit: I called them about a month prior to the actual event just to get some details about reservations. I was given a presumably complete rundown. Fast-forward: I called Wednesday and was told I'd have a manager call back. No return call. I called around 12 times between Wednesday and Thursday with no answer. I was persistent because this was the only local hookah bar that seemed to our liking. By Friday, I finally got a response in which I was informed that in order to reserve, I would have to physically come in and purchase a bottle. That was a definite inconvenience because the person who would actually have to pay was now out of town. So, I gave it a chance and told my party to just see if they could go in when Saturday arrived. I stayed back due to illness. The place was really packed according to the birthday boy. He assumed he had reservations there, which he somehow didn't comprehend when I explained everything to him. However, when he mentioned my name to the owner or manager, he remembered our conversation and my persistence and decided to seat them within a short time frame.

It is actually called the Palm Room and it is located in the back of the high limit tables area.  It could easily be mistaken for a lounge where high limit gaming goes on.  I have been to the casino four different times and this was actually my first time stopping at the lounge since it never really stood out before.  Plus there really isn't a need to go to the lounge which is what makes it unique.  But, before I get to that I will give you a quick rundown of the lounge's offering.  The set up inside is on the smaller side and when I stopped in there on Sunday evening it was pretty full.  The room has dark wood throughout and a small bar area with a few seats.  Most of the seating is at regular tables though.  There was a small buffet with a decent selection of hot items, although I think they sometimes have a small menu to order off of.  The buffet had chicken noodle soup, potato salad, pulled pork, baked beans, dinner rolls, and an assortment of cookies.  It was a better spread than you see in the Las Vegas lounges most of the time.  Drink policy!!!  The drink policy is what sets Harrah's New Orleans apart from the other Total Rewards locations, and it is an improvement in my opinion.  When you are at the lounge you are told that you are limited to 4 drinks per day as a Diamond member. Seven Stars members are limited to 8 drinks per day.  That sounds punitive since Las Vegas and Atlantic City give you unlimited drinks in the lounge everyday.  What makes this policy unique is that you can get those 4 drinks at pretty much any bar in the casino. That includes the awesome steakhouse!  You are limited to drinks $15 and under. That is up to $60 in value per day for Diamond card holders, $120 for Seven Star card holders.  This lounge is great!! I recommend it highly if your visiting!!!",Restaurants

Well earlier this week, I specifically went into the store to get cash back so I wouldn't have to pay an ATM fee. As I approach the counter I see a sign taped to the debit card swipe machine but the sign has flipped backwards and cannot be seen from a distance. So, I stood in the short line and finally when it was my turn I had to pretty much lift the sign up in order to read it because it was not visible otherwise. The sign of course said NO CASH BACK. At this point I was slightly annoyed because why not!!!  So I asked the person working and she said she would be able to give me $20. Well when I went to swipe my card the option for up to $40 came up and I almost allowed my finger to press it but I didn't. I just go $20.   I'm not sure why this CVS is making up it's own rules about giving cash back. It seems as though the CVS policy is to allow up to $40. But to just put up a sign to dissuade people from getting cash back makes me more than bothered. There are no banks in the immediate area and there are no other options except going into the grocery store that shares the parking lot.

Everyone knows that New Orleans is full of magic but I think this spot may just be the most magical and whimsical place in town. For a while, the Music Box Village used to do pop-up shows in City Park, but now their permanent location is hidden in a nook and cranny in the Bywater that is almost impossible to just accidentally stumble upon. Personally, I think that adds to the whimsy of it because it gives me a very Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe kind of vibe. Make sure to pop the address into your GPS (it's at the end of the tracks behind Bar Redux). Some other logistical notes: limited parking so only park in the lot if you have children or need assistance (there is street parking available because it's nestled in a neighborhood), tix vary from 10-35 dollars per show (worth it), they do sell beer, there's usually a food pop-up (Congreso Cubano), kids are allowed, and no dogs (unless it's a service dog).  The New Orleans Airlift team has truly created a one of a kind experience. The venue is pretty large and is full of tiny house structures that are actually the instruments used in performances Truly, it's so hard to describe because of how mind-blowing it is, that you truly just need to visit it for yourself. Because of the setup, it's a completely immersive experience and there is no bad seat in the house (speaking of seats, you need to bring your own seats and folding chairs). It's the most original, innovative, and creative thing I've seen in a very long time. They have spring and fall shows that they usually put on and artists like Big Freedia, Solange Knowles, Wilco, and Tank and the Bangas have performed there over the last year.   Last night, I saw Tank and the Bangas perform an original piece that they developed themselves through their experimental music/spoken word/dance/art residency at the Music Box Village. In the middle of the performance, NORAH JONES rolls out on a mobile grand piano and performed a song. It was phenomenal. I've seen Tank and the Bangas perform many times but this was something totally different and unique in the best way possible.   If you are reading this, you have to check this place out for yourself. They open the village to the public during the daytime (hours and days are on their website) and I would highly suggest going, especially if you have kids. Admission is 12 bucks ($5 if you're local or a child). I highly suggest making it to a nighttime show though to fully get the magic of this spot. Even if you've seen a band a dozen times, the way the Music Box Village operates is so that the performance you are seeing there, will never/can never be replicated or done that same way again, so you are truly experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Magic. Pure magic.",Nightlife

I spent a lot of time working in the Gentilly area/Upper 9th ward and used to stop into Zimmers pretty frequently. It's a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush. If you're in a rush, it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you don't spend your entire lunch break waiting in line. The staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes, you actually forget how long you were waiting in line. Their marinated crab legs/claws are wonderful but for me, their true standout is the crab cake patty po'boy. I truly feel like it's the best seafood po'boy in town! It's incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.    Although I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours.

A 1 carat canary yellow diamond with 58 little white diamonds, all arranged and crafted beautifully. I was in love, but thought I would never be able to own such a beautiful and expensive piece of jewelry, plus I had no idea that I would soon be receiving a proposal. My man was paying close attention to my reaction of that ring. When he proposed later that evening he told me that he wanted it to be mine.

A few years later, the paint started to peel off. when I first contacted the owner, she was amenable to having the artist repair it. We had a plan worked out, whereby the owner requested that she and the artist stay in our home while the artist repaired the painting. I reluctantly agreed to that. This would mean a trip from my main residence to Florida, but I was willing to accommodate in order to get the painting repaired. By this time the paint had started to disappear, either flaking off or completely absorbing into the fencing. There was a short-lived alternative plan whereby the owner would pick up the painting on her way through Sarasota to or from Miami, take it back to New Orleans, and then ship it back to us. After a very long time of negotiations, she notified me that I would have to ship the painting (I have no idea how would I would go about that) to her and she would have the artist repair it, but I would have to pay for the artist to reapply the paint, which by now is disappearing.

The mushroom tart I ate today was rich, buttery, and delicious. Of course, it's a bakery so they also have sweet baked things that looked very good.  They have sandwiches and salads that are just as creative as the baked goods:  this week they have a salad special with octopus and kale that looks so good from the photo they posted on Twitter and Facebook, it's haunting me and I might have to go back and try it for lunch tomorrow.  They also make their own bagels, which is super exciting for this born-and-raised-New Yorker.

Everything is sleek and new, and quite impressive. I'm a fan of their lighting, but that's another story.   I was salivating at the menu upon first glance. I settled on their Pho my first go around, and I was so very satisfied. Their presentation is flawless, and their amazing food just makes the whole experience even more delightful. Yes, they may only have one size to their Pho bowls, but to be honest, that could be the least of my concerns. I've since gone back and tried numerous menu items - among my favorites are the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, the Grilled Shrimp Spring Rolls, and the BBQ Pork Vermicelli Noodle Bowl. Tasty, Tasty, Tasty.   At the moment, they're still in their first few weeks of being open. They have a delightful owner (who even let my roomie and I be served before they opened for dinner the other day!), and staff who are very eager and apologetic for mistakes made. I haven't had a problem waiting for my food, as all of the times I have gone there, my food has been brought to me in under 10 minutes. I've had to wait longer at numerous other restaurants, so I don't see the wait for food as an issue.   Cost wise, Magasin is super affordable, with most meals costing under $10. I love meals that don't break my bank and Magasin caters to these needs.   A few tips - Magasin is BYOB (no corking fees), they do take-out, avoid the busy hours of the day (i.e. 12pm, 6-7ish). I haven't had a problem yet rolling in around 5:30, right when they start up dinner, or a little after the lunch crowd.   To make a long story short, this is my new go to Pho shop. It may not be like those Pho shops on the westbank, but I've fallen in love with Magasin, and will continue to visit this darling shop frequently. I've been going back continually, and quite frankly, you should give it a shot.",Restaurants

They pour short, which is obviously a HUGE issue. There is an internet Juke box, which I believe is the WORST invention to ever plague a bar.

Our dinner kicked off with the most amazing house biscuits and butter that will have you begging for the recipe.  The rest of our dinner was comprised of several selections from the First course menu. We had the daily oysters which were great. Followed by the Brussels sprouts, delicious but the crispy chicken skins were a bit of a let down, they needed more flavor.   The smoked tuna tartar is great but the sweet chips can overwhelm the dish. Definitely get the marinated shrimp and jalapeÃ±o jus it is a wonderfully fresh and bright dish.   To close thing up we had the dobeger cake with lemon curd and chocolate ice cream, as if that wasn't enough they pour this amazing chocolate sauce on it when it arrives that will have you just dying as you wait to dig in.

I knew it wouldn't go a long way with the reviews I had seen, but what the heck.   I invited my boyfriend and another girlfriend of mine to come along.   My first disappointment came when we ordered two dozen oysters and our server returned to tell us they had run out. We also ordered the lobster with blackened steak  $40, BBQ shrimp appetizer $9, Crab cakes $12, fried shrimp platter $16, and three alcoholic drinks totaling $35. So it was expensive... and I was prepared for that.   I do not mind expensive prices, as long as it is worth it. The steak was very disappointing. We ordered is MEDIUM and it came back medium well. It was very dry and bland. I had to ad a whole lot of A1 sauce. I have never used A1 sauce because I've never had such a bland steak. So they lost major points for that. Also, I was not at all impressed with their BBQ shrimp appetizer. I've had much much better. And I'm obviously local so I have credibility when I say I've had better. There are way too many other places to get better BBQ shrimp to name.   It was overall okay. I probably wouldn't come back on my own, unless someone asked me to join a group. I certainly do not think the food is worth what the price is. I think it is a tourist trap since it is on Bourbon Street and tourists probably think that's real and authentic NOLA food. It kinda is, but certainly not the best. You can go to other great restaurants and pay the same price (which I won't mind) much muc better quality food. If I had to suggest something to this restaurant (as a business owner myself) I would lower the prices by 30-40%. Sell more volume and they'd probably even make more money.   I get asked a lot by tourists to recommend them a place to eat, since I have a shop in the French Quarter AND on Magazine Street, when I'm in the Quarter I have and never will recommend this place. If someone asks me how this place is, I would not recommend them at all, and evens lightly discourage it.   Not trying to be mean, just being honest.

Here's the deal.  You are treated to an evening with a local chef  where you get to sit in the kitchen with them as they cook you a wonderful 3-4 course meal (go with Frank Brigtsen - usually Thursday evenings).  I must warn you that it is not cheap, $150 per person. But for this price you get a once in a lifetime event - in my opinion.   The evening starts early, about 5:30, at the plantation on Bayou road. Judy greets all of her guests at the door and then the fun starts. Enjoy some complimentary wine (included in the price) and relax and get to know your new dinner companions - usually a meal is for 10 people or so. Tour the plantation or simply kick back and enjoy.  Judy is a wonderful hostess and does a great job of keeping the wine flowing. ;)  Then everyone moves into the kitchen where you sit around the chef while they cook your meal for you. You have the opportunity to interact and ask questions or simply listen to their stories (Frank is a great storyteller) while chatting with your new friends.  Added bonus: Judy provides everyone copies of the recipes included in the menu so you can take notes if you'd like while the chef is preparing your meal.   Once dinner is ready you adjourn to the dining room and the feasting begins!  Definitely a special occasion venue but oh so worth the price - at least once!   I've recommended it to friends, co-workers and family over the years and I have yet to hear that anyone was disappointed in their evening.  Definitely start with one of Frank's meals though.

I guess they figured they'd teach me a lesson because when I got home one of the cooks had stabbed my bun about four times with their finger. I got in touch with the owner and she pretended that she couldn't figure out who was working there that day. Really??? At your restaurant? Ok.

A group of around 8 people came here for breakfast and were given quite possibly the worst service any of us have ever experienced. There were maybe 6 other guests in entire the place.  I don't think there was a manager on duty, which may have been the root of the problem.  Either way, we were treated as if we were an imposition.    Our ice waters came one at a time.  Literally, one at a time.  Then when we ordered cocktails (from a completely different server), we were told they were out of the following (not told upfront, but AS we ordered the items, we were informed they were out) - Champagne All juices Ketel One Grey Goose  And finally, they were out of croissants.   After waiting 35 min for drinks, I finally went to the bar and stood there while the server poured the beers, then I served them to the table myself.   20 minutes later, the food was served cold and incorrect, but yes, the pancakes are big.

We sat down at our table and it was sticky, and there was a dirty and also sticky fork still on it...so the assumption was that the table simply hadn't been wiped down all the way. Yuck.  We ordered and the food took a fair amount of time, understandable because of such a large party. Problem was, when the food came out, no server knew what we'd individually ordered, so it became a huge mix up with people eating others' food.  I ordered the pork belly tacos which had a great caramelization on the outside and tender inside. I also ordered the spicy beef pho, which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes.

Our server was really friendly and gave us a quick rundown of the menu, and we got the crawfish beignet as an appetizer from the checking on Yelp. Apparently the appetizer isn't free like the Yelp check-in says but it's -$10 for whatever appetizer you get. Anyway, we ordered a bunch of food including two platters of oysters, and we then we started waiting. And waiting. After maybe twenty minutes, our first platter of oysters came, closely followed by the second plate. We noticed the second plate wasn't what we ordered so we asked the waiter who took it back. We then waited for another twenty or thirty minutes for our food, and our entrees came. Our oysters never did. We told the waiter and he said there was a mixup and our oysters were given to the table next to us. The manager came by afterward and told us that she'd give us two orders of what we got on the house (too bad I don't really eat oysters). So I ate my crawfish etouffee and it was quite good. A bit salty, but good. Nice spicy flavor and a good amount of crawfish, both fried bits on top and in the sauce. I asked for more bread as well so I could soak up the sauce. I quite enjoyed that dish. When the oysters finally came after we had already all finished our meal (this was probably another 10-15 minutes), the Rockefeller oysters came and I tried one. Way too much cheese on top! Otherwise I think ok as far as oysters go. Then we asked for the check do which also took at least five minutes to get here. My crawfish dish was $17 pre-tax which is a bit pricey, and combined with the mixup and the super long waiting times, I wouldn't suggest coming here. The waiter apologized many times for the mixup which is fine, but it doesn't excuse the super long wait times for our main entrees. To be fair, my food (the crawfish etouffee) was quite good and deserves 4 stars, but the long long long wait and inefficiencies (I'm excusing the mix-up with the oysters because there was a miscommunication which I understand happens - what isn't excusable is how long we waited for our entrees/other dishes, the check, etc etc) subtracted 1 star.",Restaurants

The mac and cheese was good as was the potato salad, but again they lacked any exceptional flavor.  The greens lacked flavor too, even though she said they were cooked with pork.

I know now that although I couldn't afford it in 1992, the price was, in no way, too high, not for the workmanship and longevity of the item. Some years after 1992, I also bought myself a mini wooden clipboard to use for small items around the house, since now I was a gainfully employed member of society.

The 7oz. was way big. You can get the usual hipster burger add-ons like a fried egg, mushrooms, or super thick bacon smoked with whatever free range wood of the week people are smoking bacon with. Overall the best burger I've had after trying all of the new trendy burger joints around town. Good job.  I have to agree with some of the other posters here. The place is very small. If you like to hear 18 year old waitresses talk about bubblegum and Miley Cyrus' latest ass tattoo, then this is your place. Although, they were super duper nice and friendly. The dishwasher kid was sitting at a customer table as was the manager. Everything was a little too cozy for my taste. I had a place twice that size and it was a 2 man operation. You don't need waitresses when you can hand the cashier your wallet from the front door.   Pricing was a little off on the high side. When everyone knows you buy your cans of Coke from Sam's for about .23Â¢ a can, charging $1.75 is a bit cheeky. Cheeky monkeys aside, I spent $33 plus tip for 2 burgers, an order of chili cheese fries and 2 cokes. I'll let you decide.   Again, the food was great but the atmosphere is a bit like a week at summer camp trapped in a pup tent with all of the cast of The Facts of Life.

When I called six months later to reorder my contacts...this is where the frustration came in. I called on a Wednesday and was told someone would pull my chart and call me right back. I waited all morning and did not receive a call. When I called back in the afternoon, I was told the same thing.   I called a few days later (after never receiving a call) and was put on hold for so long that the line hung up on me.  I called back, told them what I wanted and that I was using my insurance. There was some kind of confusion on their part and they told me my insurance would not cover the contacts. I knew something was wrong and told them I would get in contact with my HR/insurance. After checking, I called them back and told them they needed to look into it because I was fully covered. They then realized no one had ever updated my chart with my most recent contacts. After we finally got everything figured out, the order was placed and I was told I would have them the next week.   After not hearing back for over a week, I called the office and was put on hold. Once again I was on hold for so long the line hung up on me. I called back and had to explain all over again that I wanted to know the status on my order...I was on the phone for 20 minutes...majority of which was on hold. I was told they had my contacts, but they just forgot to call me.   When I first ordered my contacts, I was also told I could get a rebate. When I picked up the contacts, I asked about the rebate and they gave me the information.

That's not to say I like absolutely everything on the menu, but this is the first restaurant I've ever been to where even for the dishes I didn't quite enjoy, I understood why the chef did what he did. Although I may have preferred something done differently, I was able to appreciate what the chef was trying to do and see why someone else may enjoy these flavors.   I like to cook, but I have no formal culinary cooking. My palate is above average, but hardly sophisticated. With every dish here though, my taste buds were taken on a journey of flavor. Nothing is wasted here. Every item on the plate serves some purpose and flavors interact beautifully.   For instance, the pickled vegetables plate came with kettle chips and a horseradish sauce. The sauce and the kettle chips offset the acidity of the pickled items perfectly.   On the crab dish, the garnishes interacted wonderfully with the perfectly spiced meat.  I was with a friend and we ordered a bunch of small plates to share. I was initially disappointed because I saw that the plates were really small and psychologically I felt that the small portions would lead to an underwhelming meal, no matter how delicious the food was. My feeling is that if I like something, I want lots more of it, and although the food here is delicious, the size of the small plates is not intended for sharing. I admit though, after sharing an appetizer plate, three small plates, and one entree, I was filled, even though I didn't not think I was.  Service is great and they give you new plates and silverware with each course.

13380,29.9685958,-90.0550688,Kajun's Pub,15,"Just an update regarding the only complaint in my first review of Kajuns: the smoke. They've since installed a couple of smoke eaters that have made the air extremely breathable for people who, like me, have sensitivities to cigarette smoke. I previously would get headaches because of the smoke if I stayed at Kajuns too long, as I am wont to do, but now I can hardly notice that people are smoking while I'm sitting inside the bar! (When I leave, it's a different story as my clothes still smell like smoke, but that's a compromise I am willing to make.) Just goes to show you how dedicated the Kajuns staff is to improving the experiences of their customers. Thank you Kajuns!",Nightlife

Plesantly surprised at the menu and adult beverage options. Everything adorable. Staff seemed a little aloof. Sad no wi-fi is offered, even before/after lunch hours. Food was fine, if a little stingy with portion size, because it's cute and precious.   My surprise turned unpleasant when after receiving our bill we could have eaten somewhere we could have full wait service for the entire experience.",Restaurants

It has a huge assortment of gem stones -  in tumbled variety and also for display and healing purposes.   The jewelry pieces are quite unique and affordable for the quality they have. I ended up buying a pyrite ring and tumbled stone after I had left Nola already. Communication and shipping was quick and efficient.   If you're in town, you should definitely stop by here, if only to get your crystal fix on.",Shopping
12919,29.9444002,-90.0653715,Root,21,"My wife and I came to Root on October 13, 2014. We ordered the Mexican Style Salchichas, Aloo Gobi, and Smoked Scallops. All were very tasty.   Root has an excellent selection of charcuteries. We tried the Mexican Style Salchichas, they were decent but a bit bland.   The Smoke Scalops are served in a Cohiba cigar box; the scallops were incredibly plump and tender - probably the best scallops I have ever had.   By far the most incredible part of our meal was the Aloo Gobi. Without hesitation I highly recommend the Aloo Gobi!  Our wait staff team (Kevin and Chi?) were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The location was close to our hotel (Hilton Riverside) and the interior is remarkably excellent.  Interestingly, the soft drinks are about $4.00 and refills are full-price. Otherwise, Root has great bang for the buck - I will happily come back the next time I am in New Orleans.",Restaurants

The drinks are to be expected of bourbon street especially during Mardi Gras. Got a fish bowl and split it with my boyfriend and that was enough for us. Would not drink one of those things by myself. Cover was SUPER CHEAP. While the club is empty cover is free, when it gets packed cover is $5-$10. Not bad for bourbon. Only complaint is that they played the same exact songs they did on Sunday on Tuesday. I don't know if they do that all the time though.",Nightlife

HOMEBOY!  what, you think we're stupid and drunk or something?  we reminded him of the ads, the commercials, and the big pricetag out front on the GIANT ad.  he finally charged us a fake price, and we got no receipt.  tax was wrong, actually less than shoulda been.

Burger for $8, soft drink for $3 and a basket of fries for $5. I maybe could have paid that if the food was good but it was actually really bad. Nothing special about the burger. Lettuce, tomato and onion looked less than appealing and the fries were actually soggy and dripping in oil. They were essentially inedible. And they didn't have the yogurt machine operating because of Mardi gras. Overall it was a total disaster and I won't be going back. There's a million great places to eat in New Orleans and I definitely chose poorly.",Restaurants

I went on Saturday night when a jazz trio was performing with a pair of swing/jazz dancers (friends of mine), which added to the ambiance (they perform Fri and Sat nights). It's a nice change from the majority of other venues in the area which are very crowded with standing-room-only.  We had a great server who asked our food/drink preferences and constructed a whole meal for us, including the BBQ sliders, shrimp and grits, and creole cream cheesecake. I also enjoyed a planters punch (with house-made grenadine).  This a great addition to the Frenchmen Street scene, which has been sorely lacking in good restaurants, despite the opening of Three Muses. The great bar (with all kinds of unique combinations and infusions) and the live music/dancing make it a great place to hang out, as well as eat.",Restaurants

Catahoula offers cocktails you may not find anywhere else in NOLA with its Peruvian influences. Though the cocktails are still rather expensive even during the happy hour compared to other happy hours the fact that they are not your typical sazerac makes up for it. The food menu is pretty good for happy hour with half price off appetizers. The star of the show is the upstairs rooftop bar. Very cool as you dont off see roofs used much in the hot climate of New Orleans.,Nightlife
