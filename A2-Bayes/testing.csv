Tried the egg roll, cucumbers, Dan Dan noodles, and hot chicken. I appreciated the freshness of the egg roll and it was perfectly crispy. The cucumbers were the perfect combination of spicy and cool and crunchy. The Dan dan noodles were absolute perfection. I have been searching for noodles like these since having them at various places in NYC and have not found them until now. Luvi has them, and I love that restaurant, but the noodles are not what I've been searching for. I am still thinking about the Dan dan noodles from Blue Giant. I saw all the rave reviews about the hot chicken and my husband devoured it enthusiastically-  I didn't love it as much as he did - I don't know why - it was very good though! I can't wait to try every single thing at this awesome place. Hooray Blue Giant!!!!",Restaurants
10298,29.9534746,-90.0485381,Casa Pelican B&B and Cooking School,8,"We visited New Orleans for a week recently, and had the pleasure to stay with Chef Karen at her B&B. We also took advantage of the opportunity to  take two of her cooking classes.   The cooking classes: Chef Karen isn't just a great cook, she is an excellent teacher. Her classes are as hands-on as you're willing to make them. Her stated goal is to demonstrate and then step away from the kitchen. Your group of 4-8 students will do all of the prep work and then rotate through the actual cooking of multiple local classics. Chef Karen will guide you through the steps, and explain exactly what you're doing and why. She will describe not only what you are looking for as you cook, but also what you are tasting and smelling for! My wife and I have already prepared an authentic jambalaya since our return home, with the recipe and skills we learned in Chef Karen's kitchen. We felt truly prepared by her teachings. I would unreservedly recommend her classes if you get to New Orleans and can spare one afternoon/evening for an immersive experience.  The B&B: A charming home in the Algiers Point neighborhood, just across the river from the French Quarter, Casa Pelican has two bedrooms available for rental. Our room was comfortable and homey, with our own bathroom. The air conditioning was a wonderful counter to the 90+ degree summer heat. Breakfasts were homemade, delicious, and plentiful. The best thing about the place, though, is Karen. She is the warmest and friendliest person, and she opens her home to her guests as if they are friends, not just customers. She is so willing to engage with you in conversation, and she is a fount of information about the area, the culture, and of course the food.   We found this situation to be terrific, but I think it wouldn't necessarily be right for everyone. Some small caveats: - As mentioned on their listing, Case Pelican is an older house with a relatively steep and narrow stairway up to the bedrooms. It wasn't a problem at all for us, but if you aren't comfortable getting your bags up a narrow flight of stairs, this might be a problem. - It's not difficult to get from Casa Pelican to the French Quarter, but it is about a ten minute walk to the ferry (a five minute ride) and then a few minutes to get into the SW edge of the FQ.  (The ferry runs every 30 minutes until 9:45pm midweek and 11:45 on weekends.) Totally doable, but it means it's not convenient to drop back to the room midday for a rest, or in the evening to shower and change before you head to a nice dinner. It also means you're going to have additional walking on both ends of your day.  With that in mind, I have to say that my wife and I feel like now we have a great friend in New Orleans and we really couldn't imagine heading back there and NOT staying at Casa Pelican with Chef Karen. And head back there we will.",Shopping

This was our last night in town and we looked up a nice dinner place with music, that was smoke free. I was able to make a reservation online, for 7pm, without any trouble at all.  We were placed by the musicians which was really nice. The live jazz was great but the food was even better.  I ordered the soup, Chicken Tortilla so, and this was so good. I can only say yum!  My friend ordered the Crab Cakes, and he said they were the best he had ever had. He said they were moist and not dry at all, and the flavor was to die for. Along with the Crab Cakes, he got the Kale salad and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were so delicious! They did not need anything on them, they were perfect!  My other friend had the Prime Rib. It was cooked to perfection and the meat was very tender and flavorful. This meal came with the Kale salad and mashed potatoes as well, but you could get the spinach or other vegetable if you prefer.  My spouse ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye and said it was the best they had ever had. Tender, juicy and full of flavor. This meal came with mashed potatoes as well.  I had the Center cut steak, and I get mine well done. This is the most tender steak I have ever had. I have eaten at other high end steak houses, like Ruth Chris, and this was by far, the best steak I have ever had. (Please note that Ruth Chris's was very good when we went a few years ago, before I knew about Yelp!) Most know that when you order a well done steak, you just know it will be dry, a little burnt, and need something to give it flavor. This is just something you get used too, but not here.  I was shocked! Really shocked. This steak was moist, had just the right amount of spices and just melted in your mouth.  My meal came with a baked potato, which was very big and very good.

Overall, the meal was fine. The sandwich was about a foot long filled with meat, cheese and peppers. It was light on mayo and I wished there had been more. While the fries were dusted with what looked like creole seasoning, they still lacked flavor. However, they were hot, crispy and plentiful. When I make fries at home, I just use salt and pepper and they are the bomb.com. For some reason these fries were missing something and I couldn't figure out what. Fat maybe? Or maybe it was the particular brand.   The filling was tasty, but I think I would've preferred po-boy bread because the hoagie was chewier than I would've liked.

I lived in New Orleans for ten years pre-Katrina, and had remembered the Coffee Pot as a charming, old-school restaurant with great food and friendly service. I was shocked at how poorly we were treated, and embarrassed that I brought my friends there, some of whom had never been to New Orleans before.   I would like to begin by saying that I have worked in the restaurant industry my entire life, I am beyond patient and understanding when dining out, but there is absolutely no excuse for the way we were treated. We went for brunch on Sunday, 3/1. There was a bit of a line, but it was moving quickly so we decided to wait. What a mistake! As we got closer to the front, we were greeted by a surly hostess who seemed annoyed that we were there. She asked how many were in our party, gave us a severe look, and disappeared.   We were eventually sat at a table with no menus and waited. And... waited. For a long time. Eventually a waitress shuffled over. At this moment my friend had been showing me a photo on her phone, and our waitress barked at us in a caustic tone to, Put your toys away.""

Also saw maybe a manager, so I'm not sure why nobody was working their appropriate sections. And I don't think they have table numbers because the servers were confused where orders were going. But back to my experience. The wait was getting so bad that someone else decided to take care of us. I think she saw the aggravation in our faces. She took our drink order and of course that took a while. We also ordered hookah. They were out of one of the flavors we wanted. The hookah took FOREVER to come out. Finally it came out. The hookah burned so fast it was crazy how fast it was burning out. We saw someone else send their hookah back and leave. Also, there was a $5 charge to add ice to the hookah and if I'm not mistaken there's also a charge for them to change your coal. It was all interesting.

Callaloo is a Sunday favorite of mine growing up, and their offering here was outstanding.  The oxtail was fall of the bone tender and paired so well with the Callaloo and rice.

I moved to New Orleans from a city where Bar Method (a similar type of workout) was incredibly popular, and because I had gotten myself addicted to it (seriously!), I was really excited to find Pure Barre here.  In theory, Pure Barre is a phenomenal workout that will lengthen muscles and lift and tone everything. The substance of the class is a combination of ballet, pilates, yoga, and strength work. It definitely helps to have a dance background, or at least some level of body awareness, but it's not necessary. It is similar to Bar Method (opening soon in Covington but not in New Orleans yet) and Xtend Barre (two New Orleans locations).  My main problem with Pure Barre is that the instructors don't give form corrections - which may seem like a minor point, but when you're doing the small, isometric movements that are the key to the class, it's very important to have proper form. Otherwise, you don't get the full benefit of the exercise, and you could even hurt yourself. Unfortunately, Pure Barre places almost no emphasis on form. Yes, the teachers will occasionally remind the class to keep proper form, but they do not give any individual corrections. Because of this, in the classes I've taken, over 50% of the class will have incredibly poor form at any given time...and they probably don't even know it! I am a former dancer with a lot of experience in this type of class, but even I sometimes am not sure whether my form is right - in Bar Method, I relied on instructors to correct me, but in Pure Barre, I just feel like a fool going through the movements in what's possibly a completely improper way.   What I also dislike about Pure Barre - and really, this is more me missing Bar Method than disliking PB - is that the instructors aren't as enthusiastic or encouraging as I feel like they could be. Bar Method teachers encourage each student by name, giving positive feedback when it's deserved. Pure Barre teachers do this once in a blue moon. As a suggestion, to any of the teachers reading this, a little motivation really goes a long way!  My other main problem is the price - at $25 a class, and $225 for a month of unlimited classes, Pure Barre is one of the most expensive workouts I've ever heard of, especially in New Orleans. The new client special of $100 for an unlimited month of classes is a good deal, but after that, I don't think it's worth it.  The instructors at Pure Barre are all very nice, and Pure Barre COULD be a great workout, but it just isn't there yet. I'll wait for Bar Method to open in Covington instead.",Shopping

I live just outside the city now, but was in for a convention and my co-workers and I stopped in to La Cote as a last resort for lunch.  It's at a hotel, it looks generic-trendy, two things that usually mean bad, over-priced food.  Thats not the case at all.  The menu is full of real Louisiana food, each dish sounding more delicious than the next.  My co-worker got a shrimp po-boy that was so over stuffed with fried shrimp that she ate it with a fork.  The shrimp tasted sweet, like they were fresh from the gulf.  Another co-worker got the glazed salmon, which looked ridiculous and she gasped it was so good.  As for me, I got the roasted beet and goat cheese salad (yes not LA cuisine) and as the waitress said that the seafood stew was her favorite, that as well.  The stew came in its own tiny cast iron pot, that looked too small for my appetite, but every bite was full of sweet crab, crawfish, shrimp and the fantastic broth.  It was seriously delicious.  The salad had thick beet slices, goat cheese and arugula placed in a tower so when I cut into it i got a bit of all three.  The beet was soft, sweet, and in perfect ratio to the cheese and arugula.  The one fault I can find is that were some yellowing arugula on the plate, but arugula's so delicate that's understandable.  It was a fantastic salad none the less.  One thing that was unique about this place was the servers (it was lunch) were all women of color.  In a city dominated by white men in that position, that's really incredible.

Once we got in there was a kind person that swipe their card for us so it tipped me off that maybe we needed special permission to go up there. When we arrived we began to  head past the bar to find a seat and a  security officer said that he needed our card. I explained that we were non-hotel guests and just wanted to enjoy a drink at the bar. He was extremely rude and non-communicative and would not even look at me. He just sat there and watched YouTube videos on his phone and refused to engage with me on any level.  I tried to be as friendly as possible and ask questions and he just grunted at me while continuing to watch videos on his phone. I asked him if he knew of any other places and basically refused to answer or even look at me. So we just turned around and walked away. It was extremely awkward and uncomfortable. Thankfully he was really the only ridiculously unfriendly person that we had come in contact with it in Nola during our stay.

Oak fits the bill when way up in the Riverbend.  The space is a departure from the smaller, darker wine bars that populate this city (and that I populate) and it's quite lovely. They somehow maintain this fairy light glow with the lightly-colored walls and furniture illuminated by pretty light fixtures. I'm gonna say it: a more feminine vibe, but that doesn't mean a man couldn't - and shouldn't - feel comfortable here.   And on that note, the crowd isn't primarily female, so there's that (calling all the single ladies). The crowd is very Uptown -grad student rather than the undergrad ubiquity at places like Monkey Hill and St. Joe's Bar (and Delachaise on weekends). Mature and polite young people for the most part and god, do I sound like my Great Aunt Tillie right now. Very different from the all-ages scene at my beloved Patrick's Bar Vin.  Staff is top notch at Oak! Although the place was bordering on very busy when we arrived, we were greeted and seated, but then opted for the circular bar that is awesomely situated in the middle of the room. Both bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive, even asked us if we wanted food. Sadly, I had just consumed enough Japanese food to feed a small village down the block at Chiba, so all I could do was admire the brief menu that promises tasty bites of exquisite things like frites and cheeses and olives. Oh and you small plate haters be rest-assured they have full entrees, too.  Wine list is as you'd expect: lengthy! I've been on a bubbles kick again and they've got 'em. A good selection of reds by the glass but definitely not as extensive as Delachaise & Patrick's. If vino ain't your thing, they have beer and a full bar.   One minor thing: not sure about the acoustics of the room. The band playing was just too loud for the otherwise delightfully hushed setting. A sound person would have rectified the situation (I could be wrong but it seems like the band did their own sound and that is never a good thing. Take it from someone who worked in the biz for years).  I'm looking forward to returning to Oak. I should remark that I came here on a Thursday night and it was the final frigid night of the week, yet it was still comfortably busy. Not sure if it's packed on the weekends, but I wouldn't be surprised, after all this is Oak St, quite the happening Uptown corridor.

I was in and out in under 10 minutes, having perused the store looking for that one needed item I desired. The clerks are friendly and patient. If I am in the area and need something, I will be back. This area is kind of a food desert. While the Dollar General does not sell fresh food, the fact that they are here in an area that is gentrifying in a scary way, it leaves the lower income residents still in need of a food source. This has been a major problem in this area for a long time, probably forever in that this is a food desert.

And no matter your mode of transportation (walk, drive, bike, Falkor, etc) head to Bywater American Bistro and order yourself some of the most creative and mouthwatering food New Orleans has to offer! The dishes offered at this neighborhood brew pub are heralded as Viet-Cajun, and we loved all of it!  We started our meal off with the cheesy egg rolls, and knew we were in for quite a treat. The outside was a perfectly crisped egg roll wrapper that crunched with each bite. Inside had mounds of oozing, gooey cheese. They were like mozzarella sticks with even more flavor than normal. For our meal we shared the  Phorrito, which had Sliced Roast Beef, rice noodles, onions, scallions, thai basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, sriracha, hoisin wrapped in a hot flour tortilla with a side of pho broth gravy for dips, and the Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos. The Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos has so many words in the title and even more flavors to enjoy! Fried wonton chips, chedder & cojita cheese, scallions, cilantro made for the perfect pairing for each of the beers we tried.  As for the beer selection, it was very impressive. We tried a few as it was happy hour pricing (bonus!) While they had many selections you'd expect, we really liked their Vienna lager spiked with New Orleans Chicory coffee because it felt like something you could only get in the Big Easy. It was almost as bold as the Deb Does Chocolate - Chocolate Stout which featured mammoth amounts of flavor.   We loved our experience so much that each night during our visit we contemplated eating at Bywater Brew Pub a second (or even third) time! The customer service was stellar too. Our waiter was so chill and friendly that I wanted to be their friend.

I stated to her that I did but based on your actions I would not like to dine here! She began to yell in front of several patrons to get out of her restaurant!  I was appalled and I did not stoop to her level by raising my voice but I did make it clear that we were dissatisfied and she will lose out on so many customers just based upon her attitude...mind you that I am African American and the guests that checked out before us that had a similar problem with their Groupon where African American as well...she definitely gave me the impression that she did not care to Serve all races, as she did not inquire about our particular situation, compared to theres...I will not be going back there, and I suggest anyone of another race or ethnicity not to patronize this business as well...upon walking to my car another Caucasian patron stopped me and said she's not sure what's wrong with her attitude yet she had her food and her visit was fine! Definitely a business that has suspension of racial profiling! Additionally these are teenagers/kids preparing the food that does not seem trained on the technique nor customer service! They need to convert to a mobile food truck as they are not fit to be an establishment!",Restaurants

There's a maple bacon sweet potato biscuit that's killer and I usually see a quiche or two in the case when I'm there, as well.   There's a little room behind the front counter with some tables and chairs if you want to hang out there for a bit. I find the chairs to be a bit uncomfortable if I spend more than an hour or so on one, but I just take that as motivation to get the hell on with the rest of my day and not spend the entirety of it in a cafe.

To be honest, these girls made me feel unwelcome.  However, once I received my order, all was well.

12553,29.95214581,-90.06810665,Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,17,"I had high hopes for the Sheraton New Orleans.  I was staying here for a convention and got a room on the club floor.  Here's the good. If you're staying on a club floor, you'll have access to the club lounge, which serves free breakfast and appetizers with a fully stocked non-alcoholic fridge.  Also, because I was on a club floor I had an amazing view of the city.  The club floors are highest floors in the hotel.  (There are 49 floors; I stayed on the 47th floor.)  The hotel was also a great place for our conference.  We had plenty of space for all the events, and the conference rooms were nice.  Plus, the Sheraton has a great location on Canal Street, so it's a short walk to Bourbon Street and the French Quarter.  Here's the bad, and the reason for the 3 star rating.  The wifi in the hotel isn't that great.  I stayed 4 nights and had to reconnect every 24 hours.  The reconnection process was super slow and would sometimes kick me off the wifi for hours.  So, that was obviously a huge inconvenience.  When I checked out, I complained to the front desk staff about the wifi and was credited 500 Sheraton points.  It was a nice gesture, but I would have preferred working wifi instead.    Second, not so great thing - no mini bar in the room.  I realize all the prices of items in the mini bar are generally outrageously expensive, but it still would have been nice to have the option, especially when the hotel requests for its guests not to bring outside alcohol into the hotel.  It just doesn't make sense.  If you don't want us to get it elsewhere, then supply us with it to begin with.     Third, false charges made to my room.  When I went to check out I was told that I had been emailed a copy of my bill.  That's great.  I love having a copy I won't lose, but the server was down, and the bill wasn't sent.  So, I asked for a hard copy.  When I got it, I noticed a mysterious room service charge on my bill that I didn't make.  I was told to call Sheraton customer service to dispute the charge.  I have dealt with Sheraton customer service before and they have always routed me back to the individual hotel because the call center doesn't have authority to make certain decisions.  I knew if I was going to get the charge removed it would be when I was checking out with a live person standing in front of me.  At my insistence that she show me the room service bill, the front desk lady finally left to hunt it down.  After 20 minutes she returned and apologized because no bill could be produced.  It really makes me wonder if something sketchy was happening.  If someone had accidently charged something to my room because their room number was similar, wouldn't a bill be available for me to see?  Regardless the charge was removed, so I was happy about that.    I appreciated the gestures to make amends for the mistakes (mysterious room service charges & spotty wifi), but I it's still annoying to have to take extra time to prove I'm not a liar.  I might come back here again, but with so many other choices of hotels in the area, I probably won't.",Restaurants

After a round of drinks we ordered and proceeded to wait nearly an hour for the food to come out of the kitchen. I'm not unsympathetic to servers, but you at least have to acknowledge to your customers when you're not living up to expectations. The band on stage made the wait a little more bearable, but the meal was subsequently rushed, as we had after dinner plans.

Let me start by saying the salesman was very nice and helpful through the process especially with the many revisions we had and are happy with the quality of our purchase. But understand that once you have purchased your cabinets from campbell and possibly other cabinet only suppliers, it is your responsibility to install them yourself or obtain the services of a contractor to install them (something we we not told till time to seal the deal) and if you are spending say $30,000 and up on cabinets with lots of detail you will need to have an experienced installer do the job. This is where the quandary is. If you are buying from a big box store or any supplier that provides installation, they will provide you with a contractor (at a cost up front at the time of purchase i'm guessing) and If there is a problem with installation such as missing, incorrect parts, or ill fitting cabinets they will confer with the store or supplier to correct the problem or if you are unhappy later with a problem you have discovered, the store or supplier will assume the responsibility to correct it even if the problem was the contractors fault.  If you purchase cabinets at one place then hire someone on your own to do the install and then run into a problem of one blaming the other, leaving you to referee the deal and later on if a problem arises good luck having one or the other take responsibility. It's like ordering a automobile in parts and either the factory assembles it or you hire a mechanic to put it together. In our case sometimes the contractor contacted campbell's but sometimes we were left trying to be the go between. Don't think a installer won't ruin some expensive trim only to claim it was never delivered leaving you to deal with the supplier who can show you on the invoice that it was delivered. See where i'm going with this. All this being said i am not saying not to use campbell's, just that quality and price being the same if you could purchase cabinets from a place that is responsible for installation you would have a lot less headaches. Also know this, if you are getting crown on your ceiling height cabinets and are also running your own crown in rest of the house, they will not match where they meet at and most of these types cabinets are generic in that they don't accomomodate just any sink and range top. you will have to do some retrofitting. something my installer thought wasn't his job, so i had to do it. and don't settle for a 10 inch overhang on your bar countertop, it's useless  .

Being a resident of the Marigny and thrilled with the new restaurant scene developing in the Bywater, I was excited about the concept of this restaurant and so wanted to like it. First off, even if you'd never been to any of these places and sampled the street food the menu touts , I still think that the food is disappointing. Unfortunately, i have actually eaten a lot of the authentic street food abroad, and Booty's renditions don't even come close! Begging the question- have the chefs or owners of Booty's ever been to these places or do they just watch the Travel Channel a lot? However, the renovation is impressive and will even look better with l little age on it- ( if they can manage to stay open that long) and the drinks are interesting and fairly fun. I wish I could chalk the whole bad experience up to ordering badly, but two of the dishes that I ordered were on the recommendation of the server- the rice balls and the empanada. One quick note that must be said, the Ramen- really? egg noodles the size of fettuccine? and you call that pork broth? I'm pretty sure I cracked the code for that recipe- soy sauce, water and maybe a bit of sugar. As a lover of authentic Japanese Ramen, I was totally offended. Here's a little tip, his month's Bon Appetit  has a great photo of what real ramen should be, check it out boys, you don't even have to Japan! I could go on, but it would just be unnecessarily mean.

Not sure if they can switch out for something but makes it look like a cafeteria.   A couple tables inside for seating.

You have butcher in the CBD, St.James Cheese company, Il Posto and Wayfare uptown but nothing really in the quarter and some days when you are down there you just want somewhere you can grab a quick good sandwich.

We had a table of 5 and were seated right away and presented with menus.   We placed our drink order and perused the menu. I don't eat chimes very often so I felt a bit lost and the menu did not explain anything about what the dishes were or how prepared (fried verses sautÃ©ed)  The server was very polite and accommodating to our table and answered All of our questions about the dishes.   We all ordered combination dinners which came with the entree, soup, egg roll and fried rice. The prices were around 10 dollars so a sweet price for all the food.   Some things that were ordered were:  Shrimp with garlic  sauce. This had a great taste and was not fried and came with vegetables also.   Shrimp with lobster sauce.  The shrimp was sautÃ©ed and not fried with this dish. This can in a deep dish and was the consistency of a gumbo. It was good but I would not order again because I wasn't into the soupy gumbo type dish.   Mandarin chicken was fried and had some kind of sauce on the top. The sauce wasn't sweet not spicy. I only took a bite of this but could not tell you what kind of taste it had. Resembled chicken fried steak with gravy type sauce on top.   #tonsoffood",Restaurants

It was during Mardi Gras and we had a peacock theme. The wedding was held at Broussard's restaurant in their courtyard which is already a beautiful space in and of itself. But what Shane did to the courtyard was simply like a fairytale. The conditions and constraints he had to work in due to the Mardi Gras festival and all the road closures and whatnots did not make this an easy event for him. He rolled with it all flawlessly.  In our initial consult many months ago back in April, we outlined a vision. We asked for blues and greens, whimsy and romance but in a way that did not detract from an already beautiful outdoor setting. What he gave us was blues and greens, feathers and bling tastefully placed everywhere with lots and lots of candles and romantic touches. He nailed our vision and delivered in spades.   I will say that we had a lot of unique touches and requests to include with our wedding and shipped several boxes of things down for Shane to place and include in our overall design. He nailed them perfectly and when I walked in and saw everything from our time capsule to our crazy hand made arts and crafts guest book table all so perfectly displayed I breathed a sigh of relief. It's a little nerve wracking to have a destination wedding (we are from the West Coast) and wonder will the end product really reflect my vision... It did!   And then I will say about the lighting... About two weeks before my photographer realized there wouldn't be enough lighting to provide for good photos. I contacted Shane in a panic and he handled the last minute freak out with skill and calmness. I know this may make me seem either neurotic or a bridezilla, which I'm neither... But I digress...

After 5 min of my food getting cold I finally flagged down our waiter (who really didn't seem to care that she had only been to our table to take our order) and she took about another 5 min to get the silverware. Come on people. You have 1 job. Then I notice that what my dad ordered isn't what was put infront of him. They sent it back and got him the right thing. By the time he got his correct food- we were finished ours. Then to top it off they put the wrong order onto our bill. Luckily my dad checked but seriously the waiter still had only been to our table that 1 time to get our orders (and the brief set down of our silverware). This is crap service and the fact that my dad gave her 20% tip because of their retarded electronic tabletop cashier thingy is heartbreaking.

I showed up at 10:30pm and the front door was locked because they lock it between the hours of 11pm-6am...I rang the doorbell and went to the front desk where I wasn't greeted. I then introduced myself and said I had a reservation, started the check in process then the girl at the front desk took a phone call, then another phone call....11:10 I check in and head to my room, which was smaller than described the floors dirty and a little dusty, not too bad but it doesn't look like they clean as well as other hotels. I take a shower in the morning and yes the rain shower head though looks fancy isn't the greatest when the shower doesn't close so water does get everywhere. I have a street view which is really loud but didn't effect my sleep, but I'm not a light sleeper. My biggest issue was when I was randomly walking through the Nola streets having a good time and decided to check where a free atm was and looked at my account and saw that they charged me again for a room that I prepaid for, I went back to the hotel asked them to fix it and also just randomly checked hotel prices and exact same room for more than half the price. So let me get you the quick details: 1. I was not greeted when I entered and took 30+ mins to check in.  2. The room wasn't as big as described(they explained to another resident that is European style so it is the same size just looks smaller...) 3. They double charged me (when i first made the reservation i thought I would actually be charged then, but i wasn't and just randomly without warning they did 2 separate transactions so if you're not prepared for that i don't know what to tell you!) 4. They won't prove match their own rates after you check in. If i wouldn't have checked they would have prove matched my last day because you need 72hrs to do it, so for a Sunday I'm paying $348 bit if you checked in right now you'd pay 135... I have this place a two when I started writing based off ambiance because even though it's small, the exposed brick and crappy hardwood floors do lol nice...that's it, customer service isn't the greatest, fare practices are out the window and street noise is loud. But if you want to stay here after all that, well I warned you. I checked in Thursday night at 11:10pm it's 4:05pm Friday and I'm writing this review...Oh housekeeping starts around 9am so be prepared for the knocks on the door but they're cool!

The architecture of the dining room was very cool as well - it had a very Victorian feel, which I personally love.

When I go to a coffee shop I usually go to stay and relax, often reading or sketching. It is the perfect place for that, with both indoor and outdoor tables, a booth, and a counter.

Because the crawfish aren't as SALTY as they are at BF, and because the lady who runs the operation at Captain Sal's is ADORABLE and always fishes out the biggest crawfish in the batch to toss into the bag for me.

The sauce came with plenty of shallots and garlic for flavor, and the mussels were served with crusty bread for dipping. All for $9, a price I will happily pay for something I would never make at home. I also ordered the house greens on the side ($3), which were cooked and seasoned well with a vinegary taste and pork hock. My boyfriend said they tasted like the greens he used to eat in North Carolina.  The deliciousness of the mussels tied with the sweet potato croquettes ($7). They were so amazingly crispy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. The pairing of a salted plum jam was SO delicious and inspired. Even my boyfriend liked it and he usually hates jams and jellies.  The only item that didn't impress us as much was the pork and bacon terrine ($9). I thought it had a good flavor, similar to andouille. In the restaurant's defense, it may just be that I don't care for terrine. I liked it a lot more than the texture of pate (more similar to sausage), but wasn't a big fan of the cold chewiness. My boyfriend who is a big charcuterie nerd liked it less than I did. But if you are a terrine fan in general, you would probably enjoy it.  Bonus points for our friendly and accommodating server. Since the menu has the small plates"" thing going on",Restaurants

Place your order and cross over to the bar for a beer (Bloody Mary) and have a seat at one of the many tables. The hostess will then bring out your death by BBQ.   I really liked the brisket...the flavor was incredible, but it was a little dry. The poppers were wonderful and my friend stole all but one because they were that good. Those pickles?

Definitely worth trying out if you're in the area. I'm sure I'll be back!",Restaurants

I came for Sunday brunch after seeing the crazy line outside of Refuel cafe and was not disappointed. Best plantains I've ever had in my life. The chicken flautas were out of this world and the tortilla that my breakfast burrito came in was phenomenal and authentic. The papusas were great too! Service was great.

Restaurant owners in the CBD learn from Isis' mistake,  if someone orders a sandwich in the business district and it takes over an hour your going to lose your client base. Also, have your order ready they bullied my friend into a panicked order of chicken cordon bleu that he said he wouldn't  feed his dog and his dog is dead.",Restaurants

The avocado fries and the amaze-balls are also delicious to add on to your order.",Restaurants
